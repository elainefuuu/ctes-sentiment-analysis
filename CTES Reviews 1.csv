6,GFW0001,One of the most useful course on IT Management!
7,GFW0001,"I was disappointed because the name is misleading. The course provides a good introduction & overview of the responsibilities of the CTO, but has very little specifically digital content. It deals with two-speed IT in a single short lecture, so of course the treatment is superficial. It is easy to find more in-depth material freely available, on the McKinsey website for example."

17,GFW0001,Very structured approach. Thank you for sharing with me.
18,GFW0001,"Program demystifies the evolving world of CIOs in a typical global corporation.Coverage being introductory familiarizes participants nicely through some of the nuances & emerging trends.When I took the course participant numbers was fewer, so feedback was quite delayed. So one should plan to be patient to get their peer reviews.Based on peer reviews i sensed much variations in their expectations.Few sections are in French with Subtitles.Subtitle quality requires audit/review."
19,GFW0001,N/A
20,GFW0001,Very relevant and useful course designed for CIOs
21,GFW0001,This course does not say anything about digitization which is the core subject of the digital wave.

30,GFW0001,Great course information and content ! Very interesting ! Unfortunately there is a peer graded assignment which 3 classmates must grade. Although two of my classmates gave me all passing grades one classmate gave me all 0's and didn't really justify why; which made me have to re submit my assignment. Thankfully 3 other amazing classmates saw the quality of my work :)

57,GFW0001,Great course and very informative.
58,GFW0002,-
59,GFW0001,I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking.The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.
60,GFW0001,This course doesn't contain any new information. It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.

85,GFW0018,"Great content, I still need to go over it to glean the wealth of information that has been put together here."
86,GFW0018,"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice."

98,GFW0031,"This is a very basic course on 3D Printing Technology but every aspect of the technology is artistically explained. All the various points of view are considered and a 360 degree idea is passed on to the students.By taking this course, students who are contemplating about their involvement in this revolutionary technology will be able to finally decide their future course of action, which I believe will be positive.In short, this course will provide you a base whereas the further courses, I think (as I haven't taken up the rest of the courses till now but I intend to) will add sufficient value to your knowledge.Regards."

208,WIA1002,"I am very glad to see courses like this one on Coursera. The course itself is well structured and contains a lot of useful information and that is exactly what I needed in one place.My only complaint is the price of the course - I think it is a bit expensive especially for this first part of the specialisation - it is an introductory two week course with a lot of advertising...£40..common..are you serious?? A lot of people will buy personal 3D printers or kits after the course, some of them will make a decision to buy a 3D printer for a company they work for (as myself), Fusion 360 subscriptions etc. These companies should sponsor such courses to make them more affordable - it is their interest.I made several courses on Coursera already (Mechanical and Electrical Engineering), they were 5 to 8 weeks and comprised a lot of quite hard work from mentors and students and were only £32 for certificate.I like the idea of this specialisation but I decided not to pay for the certificate because of its price. Although I am very happy to have access to the courses and I thank you for you effort!"
209,WIA1002,This is a really great introductory course on 3D printing. I was completely new to the subject and in just two short modules both the basic techniques and some modern day applications were explained in a really clear and engaging manner.I was also really interested to learn about the business examples that made use of these new technologies.Recommended for anyone who is interested in new and exciting techniques!
210,WIA1002,Great endeavor! You can now learn about the 3D printing technology at your own place.
211,WIA1002,An excellent course. I only wish the portion on non-financial metrics included some examples or insight in how best to quantify non-financial metrics in do
212,WIA1002,"week 1 and 2 were kind of boring, but maybe necessary; weeks 3 and 4 were more interesting from a business point of view (i'm not so much interested in accounting as in business decisions).the virtual class of professor Bushee was quite funny :)"
213,WIA1002,"Excellent course, first 3 weeks were very technical but highly informative. Quite a bit of accounting knowledge is required to understand the work. Last week of lessons were more simple and intuitive to understand, but overall, a very insightful module"
214,WIA1002,"First of all, I really enjoyed Professor Ittner's presentations. Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here. ""I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to"" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're ""stocked"" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that ""we're going to run some narly regressions"", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants. These segments add absolutely zero value. They lengthen the time of the course. To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together."
215,WIA1002,This is the first English course I have taken.Though at first it was kind of difficulty because of language(especially the terms) and profession knowledge(it is a comprehensive course and I am still learning courses concerned at school)the course is really worth taking. I have learned a lot .and it stimulates my interest in accounting.
216,WIA1002,Thanks for your help.
217,WIA1002,"It was fast, but provided a good overview. I would like some cases to work and to apply the methods to."
218,WIA1002,Providing what are the insight we need to look before investing in a company and how interpret the balance sheet and found the
219,WIA1002,No practical knowledge learnd and no clear examples of the topics. Too complex all the course
220,WIA1002,"The course itself is good. Nevertheless, it says that it doesn't require any previous experience... But there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts."
221,WIA1002,Very good course but videos sometimes too long
222,WIA1002,Lecturer baik
223,WIA1002,Really fantastic and interesting intermediate accounting course
224,WIA1002,"weeks 1,2 and 3 were not satisfactory according to me. the video lectures were difficult to comprehend. week 4 was very good."
225,WIA1002,this is the best course that i ever studied it
226,WIA1002,"I love the professors, but unfortunately, I do not feel much connection to me (not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements; I am not an investor, and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements).The Managerial Accounting (week 4) transforms my mindset!! I really appreciate that. That one single week of course can literally help so many companies/NGOs. That week 4 should be promoted more!!"
227,WIA1002,"This is fantastic course. The only catch is that it doesn't have Chinese translation, which makes it a little bit more difficult for non-natives to learn. The quality is great."
228,WIA1003,-
229,WIA1003,It's a very good course.
230,WIA1003,The three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis.
231,WIA1003,"Course was not easy to grasp, lost interest after the first week and I barely got through the quiz at the end."
232,WIA1003,"This course is difficult for me since it requires extensive background of accounting studies while my background is in HR and Strategy. However, I grasped the opportunity to make up my finance and accounting related knowledge, and passed the course finally after several times of trial and error. The professors taught the course in a very interesting and fun way, which could have been a boring class with lots of difficult and hard numbers but turns out to be a class full of fun and laughters. I like the way the two professors are presenting the knowledge, as well as doing the analysis. Thanks for providing such a course! More courses like this should be organized to benefit more professionals or students in need!"
233,WIA1003,Very useful material to financial review of cash flow statements.
234,WIA1005,"Kursus yang sangat bermaklumat, banyak belajar"
235,WIA1005,"not a big fan of accounting honestly, but i quite enjoy the course. doesn't involve a lot of in-depth math, and its easy to follow."
236,WIA1005,"The first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization, the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how non-financial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes. I really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life. A data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business, not finding his manager's earnings management using an M-score etc."
237,WIA1005,It was very well done and very informational. Thanks again professors for your dedication and time to educate society!
238,WIA1005,My major is accounting but I still felt that it was so difficult. But I learned some knowlege which our teachers didn't tell me. Thanks!
239,WIA1005,Departments rigidity to information sharing as an ailment at middle and lower organizational levels was a notable issue
240,WIA1005,"This course made me look at Accounting in a very different way; instead of common business schedules, it actually became exciting to read and find out what was really going on!"
241,WIA1005,
242,WIA1005,Very informative and interactive. I like the style of Professor Bushee's classroom teaching
243,WIA1005,"I believe that it is a fantastic course for those have some basic accounting knowledge and the willingness to enter compliance area. More importantly, the concept linking financial and non-financial decisions are also fantastic to bring accounting to life! I do love both professors in the module!"
244,WIA1007,great accounting ratio analysis
245,WIA1007,Good overview on Financial Analytics!
246,WIA1007,"This was very challenging course for me... I felt you needed a strong knowledge base of financial statements to really understand what triggers potential fraud, deception. I think I will need to re-review the course material to reinforce the concepts. Thanks!"
247,WIA1007,Focus of first 3 week is more of an audit analytics material. Quiz material could have been more interactive. Overall OK course.
248,WIA1007,"An excellent course with Professor Bushee, as always (I completed a previous ten weeks course with him, also a superb quality programme of study), very practical, focused and complete, and absolutely enjoyable."
249,WIA1007,-
250,WIA1007,This has been a challenging course for a person that doesn't have any accounting experience
251,WIA1007,"Professors need to undergo a presentation and Instruction Design skills. They were talking a lot and everything was going over my head, the reason was there were not visual prompt for the examples, specifically in the last week."
252,WIA1007,Excellent overview of identification of problems in financial statements
253,WIA1007,"This is an excellent course, especially for someone with near zero knowledge of financial statements and their analysis. The concepts are clearly presented, with interesting details and supporting examples of their use. The inane comments by cartoon characters using poorly simulated accents is only mildly irritating."
254,WIA1007,Interesting course with good and clear explanation. Easy to understand and with fun!Thank you!
255,WIA1007,Very clear. Excellent instructor and it's free if you don't pay for the cert! Can you have a better class experience? Thank you Prof. Bushee!
256,WIA1007,Frustrating
257,WIA1007,A very interesting course. Strengthening the advanced accounting concepts.
258,WIA1007,It was very breathtakingly and I think that it is the best course within the Business Analytics specialization.
259,WIA1007,difficult for people without accounting background to take.
260,WIA1007,Dissapointed with the course content
261,WIA1007,"The contrast of provided material is quite huge. In first for weeks all the analytics are explained and decisions are shown, in the last week only principles and overall concepts are introduced."
262,WIA1007,"I have many hours of undergraduate accounting and finance course work under my belt and this class gives you a tremendous overview of financial statement analysis. The only disadvantage is that the professor creates the workbooks for you and you only have to answer conceptual questions. While this would be great for some, I was hoping for some more hands on work to practice."
263,WIA1007,"Excellent Material and instructions. Hard, but valuable"
264,WIA1007,"Although I am not a native speaker,but I try me best to understand it!Good teacher!Good Coursera!"
265,WIA1007,Very insightful topic! A good overview of the use of analytics in accounting!
266,WIA1007,"was worth the time, thanks professor"
267,WIA1007,I have thoroughly enjoyed this course. The whole idea of earning management was cool. I will highly recommend this course to all.
268,WIA1007,"Awesome Course! Very funny and really sophisticated! The last part is eye opening. Best course in this specialisation!It is not for beginners though, you should have a solid understanding of accounting for the first 3 lectures."
269,WIA1007,"Besides serving as a refresher of a few accounting topics, this course really delivers on the topics of analyzing financial statements for possible fraud and linking non-financial metrics to financial performance."
270,WIA1007,I really appreicated the tools and techniques presented in the course. Very very valuable for Merger and Acqusition projects that I will be involved in (if ever)
271,WIA1007,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.
272,WIA1007,i love professor Brian J Bushee!!
273,WIA1007,Great concise lectures and examples. Useful supplemental files. Entertaining Q&A in Brian's sessions.
274,WIA1007,"Rather robust material with strong focus on ""deceptive"" practice detection. A lot of ratio analyses, each with its own moniker which I found tedious. Informative and confirmed that I don't have the ""accountant gene""."
275,WIA1007,"Sorry to say but among the four courses of this specialization, this one really disappointed me. Not the fault of teachers or institute, i think the only mistake they made is try to fit too many topics in one course. Anyway this is only my opinion!"
276,WIA1007,-
277,WIA1007,Very practical and complementary for other accounting courses.
278,WIA1008,The best auditing course out there!
279,WIA1008,"The first 3 weeks demonstrate how to analyze financial performance based on accounting data taken from a company's reported income and investment decisions (10-K for example). The material is presented in an interesting manner with extensive use of Excel spreadsheets to demonstrate the calculation and application of common performance metrics and ratios. The test are challenging and interesting. I retook test I had passed because the information cover was interesting and the test provided an excellent learning opportunity. The fourth week deals with liking non-financial measures to financial performance. Within a typical organization, these parameters are often the ones employees most affect and are often measured against. The concepts and methods of evaluating presented with examples to demonstrate some of the problems with linking non-financial measures to financial performance.I will be able to use what I have learned from both of these classes in my current job. I evaluate current business strategies of my company against competitive business strategies. Since the competitive business strategies must be deduced from a combination of published information and reported financial performance, the first three weeks will be of greatest benefit in this aspect of my job. The last week will be of more benefit as I help business organization within my company develop their business strategies."
280,WIA1008,Great content but animations are annoying!
281,WIA1008,-
282,WIA1008,Too far from subject
283,WIA1008,"The course and the instructor are great, but a missed some referenced material."
284,WIA1008,Thanks to the Professor Brian Bushee for the good explanations. I learned a lot. I find the module 4 so difficult for me. The Prof Christopher Ittner is speaking like CNN journalist and not easy for a non native US or English speaker like me to follow.
285,WIA1008,I love to be taught accounting by Sir Brian. A very marvellous course.
286,WIA1008,Great Course
287,WIA2001,"Really good teachers that made a ""boring"" theme (that I had in college) very interesting to watch and study."
288,WIA2001,Very good course well presented especially as the topic can be fairly complex.
289,WIA2001,Week 4 was the best and the more appropiate for the specialization.
290,WIA2001,"Thank you for offering this course. It has taught me a lot of things that I hadn't known. I'm interested in Accounting and there were some times I didn't know where I could gain the materials for study. Now thanks to your courses, I don't need to worry so much. Hope you will continue to produce more"
291,WIA2001,The Capstone project has been getting delayed since JanDont expect yourself to complete the specialization
292,WIA2001,"There was a gap between the prerequisites mentioned on the course details and those stated by Prof. Bushee during the lectures. As such, I found this course a bit harder due to tons of new terminologies in accounting."
293,WIA2001,Best course of the specialisation so far.
294,WIA2002,N/A
295,WIA2001,Prof Brian Bushee is really excellent but I felt that Prof Chris Ittner's lecture was quite fluffy for an analytics course. Would have appreciated practice problems and case study practices like the operation analytics class
296,WIA2001,This course was very informative and can easily be used in any business setting. I can go an apply the methods learned in this course to any organization's financial statement to get a better idea of their financial performance. I really enjoyed in week 4 how the information learned in prior weeks can be tied to nonfinancial measures in developing a causal model to improve the performance of a company.
297,WIA2001,Thank you so much for this good-quality course! I benefit a lot. Many thanks to dear professors!
298,WIA2001,"Really useful course, concise and resourceful"
299,WIA2001,"Very interesting course, well designed, using animated fun-makers to shoot out questions that you will probably do it yourself.Course content easy to understand. Very suited for non-accounting major analyst who wants to get some background in accounting analysis.."
300,WIA2001,Very boring
301,WIA2001,"Easiest accounting common sense. If you ever took acct , this will be a wasting of time."
302,WIA2001,"While each of the Business Analytics courses have been terrific in their own way, Accounting Analytics was the most challenging and most enjoyable. Accounting + clear information + dogs + sense of fun = a great course. Thank you!"
303,WIA2001,Extremely useful! I recommend it :)
304,WIA2002,no
305,WIA2001,Very interesting course!
306,WIA2001,Content very clear and explained by the professors.
307,WIA2001,Brain Bushee's videos are really impressive. Some areas are too technical for a beginner to understand. The rest of the material provide good understanding...
308,WIA2001,"Excellent course, professor Bushee always delivers such great explanations."
309,WIA2001,I really appreciate this instructor!! He is so considerate!
310,WIA2001,Great course!
311,WIA2001,Very interesting and provocative course. It will help you to receive additional knowledge which is very valuable.
312,WIA2001,"Bushee was fantastic! Ittner was fine, but not as entertaining as Bushee."
313,WIA2001,"Extremely useful, powerful and course"
314,WIA2001,"I loved the Accounting part of the course. It was quite hard for me (non-accounting person), however I really enjoyed the form of the lectures and the content itself (the earnings management + its revealing). Great materials Professor Bushee!"
315,WIA2001,the Best cour and the Best sitetanks
316,WIA2001,"I bit too complicated, as a lot of material placed within 4 weeks of ~15min videos."
317,WIA2001,"I recommend this course to all my colleagues. Its enriched content certainly helped me to understand things in better way and provided content in structured way, which is I liked most."
318,WIA2001,"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to. I enrolled in the Business Analytics Specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside, not outside. Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level. I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard."
319,WIA2001,Great course. Fantastic ideas around modelling equity returns based business and operational performance
320,WIA2001,good overview of analytics options within accounting.
321,WIA2001,Great course and great insights!
322,WIA2001,"Great working examples to learn Analytics in Financial Statement Analysis. Pace of videos was great. Working excel worksheet gives perfect hands on experience to vary and run the scenarios. Having done ""Introduction to Financial Accounting"" by same professor gave little bit more visibility into reading statements and understanding ratio analysis.Virtual Classroom is getting more new students in each course. I am looking forward to Advance Financial Accounting course."
323,WIA2001,Great! As always great lectures by professor Bushee!
324,WIA2001,"Very well done! Contents, delivery, clarity, everything was top notch. Thank you!"
325,WIA2001,This course was one of the toughest courses i pursued so far... I was expecting a lot from this course. from basic to advanced and more of fundamentals. this course should be floated as full specialization rather than as a part of other specialization.
326,WIA2001,"This was a good course, no doubt about it. But i felt, that the subject needed more depth that the course framework allowed. I would have liked if it had a part 2 for this course for people who wanted to go little more hands-on in this subject."
327,WIA2001,Finally i am able to complete this course. This course was little tougher than the other 3 courses due to some complicated accounting spreadsheet calculations. But i finally i am able to make it. Good Luck to rest of the folks.
328,WIA2001,The Best Course in Accounting Analytics.
329,WIA2001,Very well thought out. Many useful and applicable techniques provided that can be put to work immediately.
330,WIA2001,The course was very helpful. Thanks a lot to everyone who have made this happen!
331,WIA2001,"I would add more examples on how to populate the data, even spend time on optional videos where the professor or his assistant goes through testing ratios (something similar to Operations Analytics). I feel like the professor was rushing through his explanations and the models. Maybe people found the course very useful however I felt like there was too much text and immediate switch to Excel file that was elaborated shortly. Overall, I am not sure how to apply these ratios in my final project..."
332,WIA2001,"First of all, I would like to express my gratefulness to Coursera who presenting this excellent platform for those who is interested in ongoing lifetime education and hardworking and contributions to bring all the greatest courses from top universities around the world.Second, I thank you Prof Brian and Christopher for all your time, work especially your knowledge that you brought and shared within these videos. I truly appreciate and like the way you teaching and delivering the professional knowledge.To me, as a student who's just started stepping in accounting field, I found that accounting classes is so much interesting done by you, and it is a pure enjoyment as I learnt all the key knowledge. On there other hand, the courses gave me a general clear picture of how important and critical the accounting is in daily business management.I will continue study accounting as I pursue my professional goals and career path."
333,WIA2001,Lot of considerably complex and dry (accounting and statistics!) subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion! Quiz questions are unnecessarily complex - which (IMHO) will discourage / turn off those who are new to this subject matter in completing this course. The last week is pretty interesting though!I am taking the full business analytic course - and find that the quality and complexity of content is all over the place!! Some are way too simple and some are highly complex.
334,WIA2002,"really informative, original and useful!"
335,WIA2002,This course provides a deeper insight into financial and nonfinancial performance on a pragmatic basis. However the course itself is really brief and the exercises cannot thoroughly provide reliable measure of the understanding of the lectures.
336,WIA2002,The course makes accounting interesting and especially the examples are very illustrative. Virtual students bring some fun. The 4th week is however really integrated in the course structure.
337,WIA2002,Definitely good course for those working in either accounting or analytics. It gave me new ideas on how to apply analytical methods. Interesting examples on how to identify number management and how analytics can help to set up non-financial metrics that drive financial outcomes.
338,WIA2003,-
339,WIA2003,Insightful
340,WIA2003,Incredibile package.
341,WIA2003,"I liked it, although I felt like they were 2 courses: One for the first three weeks, another one during the last week.The ""First Course"" was OK, but it was regular accounting stuff. I was rusty on that so I enjoyed it.The ""Second Course"" was the one related with Analytics.I give it 3 Stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team. And because didn't made a proper link between Accounting and Analytics."
342,WIA2003,Thanks a lot for putting up such an amazing course
343,WIA2003,"Challenging course, a mixture of forensic and investigation method in accounting"
344,WIA2003,A technical but fun exploration of accounting analytics which completed the full gamut of analytics in a business context covered in the specialization.
345,WIA2003,Prof Brain is just superb. His hold and teaching ability of complicated subject of accounting is unmatched.
346,WIA2003,Thank you!
347,WIA2003,-
348,WIA2003,Good course if you are a beginner. Analytics is only 1 module (#3) and it is a good one.
349,WIA2003,Excellent course for aspiring financial analysts
350,WIA2003,i love this course very much!very practical and systematical content.and very useful for accounting professionbut its a little bit challenging to follow. I have watched whole the videos for more than 2 times in order to pass the assignment.
351,WIA2003,"It's ok. Bushee is very knowledgeable and a very enthusiastic teacher, but his lessons are too dense compared to the content in the rest of the Wharton BA programs. I actually like all the detail, but I think it's covered too quickly and the course should probably be made longer to deal with it all. There are ratios and balance sheet jargon just flying at you at a breathless pace. It would be better to focus on a few key ones and then walk through the examples a little more slowly. The quizzes were extremely tricky with too many choose more than one answers. It was difficult to find the parts of the video to review missed questions because 1) the transcripts are machine generated and make it difficult to search specific words and 2) it's difficult to remember where the concept was covered because there was so much in each video.The last week felt very disconnected from the first week and like it belonged in a different course almost. It was pretty good, though. I liked how it contained specific examples and charts."
352,WIA2003,Great introduction to Accounting Analytics. Unexpected lecturing dialogues. Could have more analytics or additional or optional problem sets to explore more deeply.
353,WIA2003,"I believe this is a very good course. Even I'm am a software engineer, I can understand how to manipulating the finacial report and how to detect them."
354,WIA2003,The Professor is really amazing. He makes every lecuture interesting and easy to understand.
355,WIA2003,Outstanding teacher and metodology. Best course of this kind i've come accross out of Business Schools and MBAs.
356,WIA2003,Excellent Designed course. Thanks
357,WIA2003,Excellent online course that caters to a wide spectrum of audiences with different learning backgrounds.Also love the cut scenes to the classroom where students make funny comments or ask questions haha
358,WIA2003,"Five stars is not enough to express my satisfaction and love to this course.The instructor is very proactive in community. Every questions I posted got direcly feedback from Teaching staff (and most of them are from Prof Bushee!!!)This is the besttttt course among all Wharton analytics sessions! Honestly, you have to try!!"
359,WIA2003,"A little tough sometimes, but very instructive"
360,WIA2003,"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the “tell me what I just told you type” but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students “play” with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two… “change the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?” I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going “yeah… that makes sense. I understand…” I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don’t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require “parroting” something said in the video.I’m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder’s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a “think about what this means” type question that is not necessarily “marked” but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they “go look at the spreadsheet”. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more “hand holding” and “direction” in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little “scary” for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I’m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes – this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 – Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 – talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an “increase means slower future recognition”. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 – no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford’s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures – some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students – particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students – perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don’t need to be long or complicated – just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to “play” with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of “messing” it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a “playground” sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another – so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios – one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don’t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live."
361,WIA2003,"Thank you very much for this awesome course, I really enjoyed and learned alot from it.I really liked the selected topics, they act like an intro to some really interesting fields in the programming.I've learned about NP multiple times but never found a use to it until now, the problems were really good and informative.I think the linear programming was pretty rushed, it should've been expanded over two weeks with more in details.Maybe add a problem or explain the use of duality ."
362,WIA2003,"I didn't like that course because of:-weak explanations of algorithms-almost all assignments I googled, I spent all my time googling these algorithms-when code is submitted and something goes wrong It is not possible to understand what is really happened"
363,WIA2003,"Baik, lecturer bagus"
364,WIA2003,poor course. never give any algorithm. No clue where the problem come from. The forum is only help a few people. No general ideas how to solve the problem. waist a lot of time debugging but still couldn't pass the assignment.total waste my time and garbage course.
365,WIA2003,While I like the content of the course but I felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course. I had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so I had to look around in the internet for additional resources. Nonetheless it was a satisfying experience though it took me a lot of time and effort to complete the assignments.
366,WIA2003,"Loved what I learnt, I also implemented a project using Google MAP API for the organization I'm working at"
367,WIA2003,"Inadequate student and teacher participation on forums, leaving students to figure things out without assistance or collaboration. Insufficient explanation of math concepts required to fully understand lectures."
368,WIA2003,"The problems are really challenging, thank you! However, the instructor is not very active in the discussion forum, which is a pity when you really need help and get stucked in the problem set."
369,WIA2003,"Excellent but tough course ,you need to work and it is not simply called advanced Algorithms and Complexity.You will be forced to test your code properly ,even if you didn't do it properly in the previous specialisation course."
370,WIA2003,Thank you very much. I learned a lot in this course. I recommend it!
371,WIA2003,"I enjoyed the course a lot. I cannot thank the instructors enough.It would have been more interesting if we could go deeper on linear programming, such as extension to integer programming. The discussion about the duality was a bit too fast to me."
372,WIA2006,"easy to undestand, but it needs more examples"
373,WIA2006,Good one!
374,WIA2006,"Great intro to Ableton, with good hands-on experience. Nice starting point for those who seek to expand their music creation toolset."
375,WIA2006,great fun and easy to learn.
376,WIA2006,"I personally think that I've learnt more from Google and YouTube then in this course. You can join the course for certification. Other then the certificate, I find this course not much of value."
377,WIA2006,The course gives a good basic overview of the softwareAs a newbie to DAW software it helpsActually needed it to determine if I was going to purchase the full versionI will be
378,WIA2006,Offers a nice introduction to Ableton and its Usage. However it would have been lovely if this was a longer course.. Loved the way of instructions and the topics covered.
379,WIA2006,really great course
380,WIA2006,-
381,WIA2006,must have if you want to start using ableton
382,WIA2006,"Excellent course.Great content, tasks and learning environment.It helped me to rediscover my love for creating music and how well suited Ableton is to my way of working."
383,WIA2006,"Good as a introduction, but there was only a few people on blend so it was hard to earn their votes, hope there will apear some intermediate or advanced courses."
384,WIA2006,"Great introduction to Ableton 9 for a newcomers. You'll learn basics, but those that are enough to start create music."
385,WIA2006,Awesome course for an intro or to just refresh your skills.
386,WIA2006,it's awesome for beginners!
387,WIA2006,"Cool, The best i did on line.I learned a lotThanks you very much."
388,WIA2006,to easy. enjoy everyone! also children to old papa anyone.thanks for Erin Barra
389,WIA2006,"Great introduction to Ableton. If you love music, this can change the way you create sounds, melodies, rhythms,..."
390,WIA2007,no
391,WIA2006,If only it was a week longer.
392,WIA2006,This is a great course for people who do not know Ableton. The exercises were easy to understand.
393,WIA2006,"A very good course for getting a quick and effective introduction to one of the coolest DAWs around! Barra has explained everything nicely, and in an easy to grasp manner. Go ahead if you're looking for digital music production even remotely!"
394,WIA2006,Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!
395,WIA2006,Mo comment went way too fast no contact not deep
396,WIA2006,"As thorough as possible given the time constraints. Erin Barra did a terrific job of condensing the material . I ended up appreciating the appeal of Ableton Live -- which is to say, a non-linear, clip-based DAW. The program (and Push) is endless, and I'm still learning all sorts of things. Good to have this basic foundation to work from. Thanks....!"
397,WIA2006,Great for beginners and if you want to get into Ableton DAW
398,WIA2007,"Very good course, I really wish for a next more advanced level course."
399,WIA2007,"Excellent experience. Material, instructor and pace of the course were really good."
400,WIA2007,A well-presented and thorough introduction to the fundamental tools available in Ableton Live.
401,WIA2007,A great course to teach the basics of this software!
402,WIA2007,Thank you Ms professor Erin Bara you are the pest
403,WIA2007,"Gives a soft view and precise information about what to do and how to do in Live.If you are looking for some input to start recording yourself or to start creating any kind of music, i strongly recommend this!"
404,WIA2007,Great class for learning the fundamentals and basics within Ableton live 9. Projects are realistic and designed to educate a student no matter their level of knowledge.
405,WIA2007,Great for getting me started. I feel much more confident in navigating my way around the Ableton workspace. Using blend has opened me up to some wonderful ideas and opportunities :)
406,WIA2007,Please create another course
407,WIA2007,Fantastic and helps you create music that represents you.
408,WIA2007,Fully recommend if you want to dive into Ableton Live
409,WIA2007,Great course with an even greater lecturer who helps ease users into Ableton Live.
410,WIA2007,I learned so much in this class and the instructor did a great job explaining the contents
411,WIA2007,-
412,WIA2007,Very light and practical course. Good for beginners but also nice to refresh some tips for intermediate users.
413,WIA2007,it's a great course for people who want to learn easily the base of this program!
414,WIA2007,Very helpful in acquiring necessary knowledge about Live. I would recommend this course to several others like me interested to get their hands on Ableton.
415,WIA2007,An excellent introduction to an extremely powerful Digital Audio Workstation - one which I had used for a few months but still learned a great deal from the course.Highly recommended. :)
416,WIA2007,Great course
417,WIA2007,Don't recommend.You're better off skimming through the ableton manual and using the search function to get the answers you want.
418,WIA2007,-
419,WIA2007,Great introductory course for ableton!
420,WIA2007,"I loved! Easy to learn, easy to understand. Now i can to use my Ableton and work on my productions. Very nice teacher!"
421,WIA2007,"Simply an introduction but definitely helps learn the program, at least on a surface level. You will gain basic functionality and be well on your way to crafting more complex arrangements if you desire."
422,WIA2007,Erin Barra is an excellent teacher; one of the best I've ever encountered. The course plan is well thought out and structured so that absolute beginners as well as those with Ableton experience can benefit. Highly recommend!!!
423,WIA2007,Really great course! The videos were very clear and I learned a ton about a program I've been using for years to record audio only.
424,WIA2007,"One of the best introduction to Ableton Live. This course is sharp, to the point and makes you sketch out a small track every week - a great way to get involved with the DAW."
425,WIA2007,Loving this course
426,WIA2007,Great course to start working your way around all the incredible tools Ableton offers.
427,WIA2007,I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.
428,WIA2007,Excellent overview and practice for new ableton live users.
429,WIA2007,"I have learned so much about using Ableton Live in this course. It really gives you the basic of the program and then some which is really great, especially when you want to use this program for producing and or recording. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Ableton and Berklee Online."
430,WIA2007,Excellent to start learning.
431,WIA2007,"It's a great course. The teacher is the best, very direct and understandable."
432,WIA2008,no comment
433,WIA2007,As an introduction course its very helpful. It has just what you need to get started.
434,WIA2007,"A very nice experience. I expected an entry level course, but Erin organised a well rounded path. I got a new effective approach to the Ableton Live 9 software.I recommend to develop carefully your assignments: you will improve your own skills by comparing your solutions with those of the classmates. In addiction you'll find some ""veteran"" student willing to help.Good luck!"
435,WIA2008,"While I did not have time to complete the final assignment I did find this course useful for creating a firmer understanding of Ableton Live. The peer review process is a great idea and something which I found to be both engaging and useful for networking with fellow artists.The content of the course I feel is probably useful to someone with no prior knowledge of DAWs, but this is not my first DAW. As such the course felt a little slow and the assignments a little unchallenging. Personally my peer review experience ranged from listening to fully fleshed out ideas to listening to uninspired loops of nonsense. I still feel as though I benefited from the process, however, and I gained an invaluable resource in Blend.I would love a next level - fleshing out some of the ideas touched on throughout the course, as well as exploring other ideas such as sidechaining."
436,WIA2008,I've started producing with live in a week. Amazing and clear course.
437,WIA2008,Brilliantly designed course for fundamental understanding of the DAW.
438,WIA2009,"This course covers a lot of ground in a short period of time, and does it in a way that makes it easy to quickly leverage the power of Ableton in production and live performance. I appreciated the simplicity and thoroughness of the videos, and the assignments kept me motivated. It's a great class for complete beginners, as well as intermediate users in need of a brush up. Erin has a good approach to teaching: she's efficient and clear, and her basic examples don't overwhelm the student."
439,WIA2010,none
440,WIA2009,it's a great introduction to ableton but nothing more
441,WIA2010,no comment
442,WIA2009,Keeps me connected to music and music technology even in my work life
443,WIA2009,"Learned a lot. Got me started and using the program, and making music."
444,WIA2010,"This is a great intro class, designed to be completed within the Ableton trial period. Ableton should pay Erin a commission on sales that come out of this course, because I imagine it's bringing them 100s of new sales!The materials (mostly videos) are excellent and easy to follow. I learned a lot in this short class and would love to see an ""intermediate"" Ableton class in the future.My only complaints are related to the collaboration software that you need to use for this course, blend.io. Site navigation in blend.io can be painfully slow, and the site is buggy. I would have preferred to simply share information via dropbox or some other file sharing method.The peer review process is a great idea, although I think it's really tricky to do this in a music/art, because there is so much subjectivity and not much of a rubric. (There are some quantitative questions just to verify that the student follows instructions, but the open feedback is totally open). But, overall, the peer review works pretty well and gives students an additional incentive to turn in a quality product."
445,WIA2010,Great course. Won't say anything else... if you want to know how it is you must try it!
446,WIA2010,"Great introduction to Ableton Live. Covers all stuff you need to know, and helps you through some stumbling blocks."
447,WIA2011,all good
448,WIA2010,"Excellent introduction to live 9. Very comprehensive, easy to understand."
449,WIA2010,-
450,WIA2010,Excellent for learning the basics!
451,WIA2010,"Great course! For very short time you'll learn so many amazing things. You will know in depth one professional software for music composition. You'll create 3 compositions which will be placed in musical website and hundreds or thousand of other musicians will hear it and vote for it. You will be part of wonderful group of other musicians like you taking part in the same course. You will be able to discuss with them important subject's... Great course. Thank you, Erin, David!"
452,WIA2010,Really good resource for anyone wanting to learn the basics of a super flexible software.
453,WIA2010,"Great instructor, I like how you can go back and keep going over the instructional videos throughout the course."
454,WIA2010,This course is a challenging into to Ableton Live. It is well worth the time for even experienced producers who are new to Ableton Live. I first got Ableton Live in November 2015. It is now January 2016 and I feel like I have come a long way thanks to this course.
455,WIA2010,Fun course! Excellent for beginners. By week two you are able to make an arrangement already.
456,WIA2010,"Great to start with Ableton, even i start with some youtube tutorial, this course really works for me cause i can see some errors i did."
457,WIA2010,interesting and easy learning!
458,WIA2010,"The MOOC teaches what it is supposed to, although more classes would be nice since Ableton is such a big program."
459,WIA2010,Erin is a great and easy to follow instructor! Thank you.
460,WIA2010,"Great Course, lots of feedback from your assignments!"
461,WIA2010,"anyway, I can start to make music after this course."
462,WIA2010,Thank you so much for this course. Really... very neccesary and important for people who loves music.
463,WIA2010,"I never ever would have gotten started with Ableton if it weren't for Erin's course. She made it SO easy to understand. For years, people have tried to explain it to me but only Erin succeeded in making it sink in! This course ROCKS."
464,WIA2011,-
465,WIA2010,Very good course for learning how to work in Ableton. Professor Barra teaches really great.
466,WIA2010,
467,WIA2010,"The course is an awesome intro. It could be longer! These Coursera Berklee courses are so short, sometimes they feel like advertisements for the Berklee online courses."
468,WIA2010,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The time commitment required for each week's assignment was perfect. I learned several techniques to aid me in going forward in my musical endeavors and look forward to many years of continuing to explore Ableton Live.
469,WIA2010,Great course waiting for level 2 :)
470,WIA2010,Great course! Helped me to get started with Ableton Live.Video lectures were straight to the point.
471,WIC2004,Excellent! the best way to learn!
472,WIC2004,"At this moment, I'm in the week 2 and I'm loving it...I'd really recommend it."
473,WIC2004,Very good instructions of the teacher!
474,WIC3002,"Very good introduction to this software, teatcher is great and very easy to understand. I have learned a lot of good stuffs such as how to warp audio, convert audio to midi and so on... I was used to work on cubase and I have discovered the specifities and the advantages of Live.Moreover thanks to the assignment objectives I had to force myself to be creative and It was a great feelig.Thanks for this course :)"
475,WIC3002,Great starting point for learning how to use Ableton Live.
476,WIC3002,"Really nice.. Basic, but just right.."
477,WIC3002,This course got me fluent enough with using Ableton that I can sit down and play around with it comfortably and create music. Very pleased
478,WIC3005,"This was such a cool way to get started again with music production!!...I'm so glad I found this course, and Erin was perfect, she made everthing so clear and easy...I wish it was a longer course tho!"
479,WIC3005,"It's amazing that we live in an age where you can take online classes like this for free.I went from not knowing my way around Ableton to being able to make simple tracks in a few weeks.The course load is pretty light, but it makes it easy to stay motivated and keep up from week to week.The instructor has her quirks, but don't we all. I feel like this course is great for introducing someone who has prior experience with writing music and using DAWs to Ableton Live. However, for someone who already knows the basics of Live, this probably won't be of too much use."
480,WIC3005,I enjoyed very much the lessons and I had a very good time on preparing the assignment on Ableton.A great course.
481,WIC3005,"It helped me to improve myself, understanding Ableton Live and getting better in working with the program."
482,WIC3005,"Awesome, Useful, very practical! Erin is a wonderful instructor."
483,WIC3005,A great course. It does teach you the essentials on how to begin making music with Ableton live. It even helps you search on your own if you troubleshoot. Its definitely worth it!!!
484,WIC3005,Very good course for does how just starting with Ableton.
485,WIC3005,"Great, specifically for its collaborative approach."
486,WIC3005,"This is an amazing course ! it is my second time taking it. Instructor Erin Barra does a great job with the tutorials, she really knows her stuff."
487,WIC3006,N/A
488,WIC3005,I have being waiting for this a long time :)
489,WIC3005,Good information!
490,WIC3006,Fantastic Teacher - very clear. Fun assignments and a very participatory community of students!
491,WIC3006,"work motivational, very clear, well structured on a steady groove ... excellent!"
492,WIC3006,Very good basic course. Enjoyed it very much
493,WIC3006,I am very grateful i came across this Course.
494,WIC3007,no comment
495,WIC3007,Very interesting.
496,WIC3007,Very useful !
497,WIC3007,Its just the best!
498,WIC3007,Great Introduction into the program....a quick look. I felt the tutorial in the program covered a lot and most of the info here can be found on youtube. Although you don't get a certificate for watching youtube
499,WIC3007,It is very nice for people are starting with abletobn program
500,WIC3007,"For anyone getting started this is a great course to do it with. I'm retaking this course as a refresher since I took the same class in the beginning of the year. I've been very busy so I forgot some functions. The videos & explanations make it very easy to get reacquainted. Plus what's more fun than getting some more production in, hearing your own creations & everyone else's for that matter. =)"
501,WIC3009,"This is already very, very helpful with mastering the use of Ableton, understanding how the I/O functions work, and polishing a track to the mastering level. Great program and very intuitive!"
502,WIC3009,Great overall introduction to start creating straight away. Liked it much!
503,WID3007,"Great course, I just wanted it to be more thorough :) But for beginners like me, it really helped a lot! Thank you!"
504,WID3007,Excellent introduction to Ableton
505,WID3007,Definitely recommend this short course which gives a good overview of Ableton Live's capabilities and how to use them.
506,WID3007,I love it!
507,WID3007,"good, straight to the point Course, you can learn other things in this course like Blend.io"
508,WID3007,I'm now taking this course a second time because it is so absolutely helpful and has really given me a free and friendly place to learn how to use Ableton and get started on music production!
509,WID3007,Dr banyak membantu
510,WID3007,Erin Barra is awesome..!!! Really good course to get up to speed with ableton.
511,WID3007,Excellent Course... Erin Barra is really excellent in teaching. Now I can proudly say even i can work in ableton live nicely. Thank you Coursera
512,WID3007,Great intro. Really gave me confidence with the DAW.
513,WID3007,
514,WID3007,This is a great course to introduce anyone interested in music production. I would recommend this course to any and everyone. Thank you Berklee and Erin! Can you tell I enjoyed this.And the Beats continue.Johanna -JKM
515,WID3008,"Really, really nice for learning the basics of Ableton Live. The instruction videos are short and concise, and there's a clear path forward after the course."
516,WID3008,Great class to get your feet wet with ableton.
517,WID3008,Everything on this course was amazing!Congrats and thanks so much for all!
518,WID3008,Great course. Got me started off with Ableton live. :)
519,WID3008,N/A
520,WID3008,Great tools and solid instructions. Thanks!
521,WID3008,This was an excellent course that was well explained and easy to follow.
522,WID3008,"Fun and interesting course. I learned a lot, despite already being a Live user. Reviewing the assignments of other course-takers widened my horizons and helped me gain valuable insights."
523,WID3008,"Real a great course if you are looking to learn the basics of Ableton Live 9 or just need a refresher after the break. Erin does a wonderful job of explaining the basics with out overloading you with to much information. Each assignment is to make a song. It starts with basic stuff and works toward more advanced stuff near the end. It's helped motivate me to put more time into making music and use the tools and software that I have at my disposal.A personal thanks to Erin, this class is just what I needed!"
524,WID3008,"Fantastic Course, i have saved the videos so i can review them again.I thoroughly enjoyed it, all over again. This was the second time i joined Introduction to Ableton Live but this time i decided to get my verified Certificate yay! Thank you Erin!"
525,WID3008,"Thank you so much Jeff, iy was usefull course, i think it needs to extend the material and learning's period.Thank you so much!!!"
526,WID3008,Very excellent class. Lots of great information.
527,WID3008,i had a great knowledge !thanks for offering this course i don't have such course in india .
528,WID3008,N/A
529,WID3008,Awesome Course. It was quite challenging though
530,WID3008,"This particular module (week 3) is written for those students who are already have at least a nodding acquaintance with the software.The videos move so fast that I am not able to detect what is going on. Please believe me when I say that I run a copy of Fusion 360 at the same time as a particular instructional video is playing. I toggle from one to another, taking notes from the instructional video when possible. Still, it takes me weeks, not days, to understand what the professor is doing.It is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within Fusion 360. I have been reviewing the tutorials that I am able to find -- and I have learned quite a bit of ""how-to"" information that this particular module does not provide.Why is it that some of us who are new to the Fusion 360 environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to ""fill in the blanks"" of week 3?Are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in Week 3? If so, why?Bill Clark"
531,WID3008,"This course introduced me to the different software tools that can be used for 3D Printing. I recommend this course, as well as this specialization, to anyone interested in 3D Printing."
532,WID3008,more details on ther software would definitely be useful
533,WID3008,"The instructor does an excellent job, but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a 3D software program after a week or two to earn a certificate. The certificate is worthless in my opinion. I liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs. a class of any proficiency required."
534,WID3008,"The course was enjoyable for the most partand I increased my skill level. The videos, for the most part, were good. However, consider revising some of the one for Fusion to include demonstrations for the sweep, loft, and revolve tools in the Sculpt mode if they are to be included in assignments. These were not as intuitive as the others and required reliance on videos found on Autodesk as well as Youtube. Additionally, it would be helpful to slow the pace in illustrating ""how-to"" in the videos. There seemed to be steps omitted and I found it difficult at times to reconstruct all the steps. Finally, I noticed that staff/mentor help was not readily available for weeks, when participants posted queries in the forum."
535,WID3008,This class was inspiring! I't was worth the wait. Thank you!!
536,WID3008,Very interesting course. Maybe Fusion 360 may have lasted one more week to get more indepth knowledge
537,WID3008,
538,WID3008,Interesting and very useful course.
539,WID3008,It gave me a good understanding of the software capabilities.
540,WID3009,the introduction to Fusion is more a customer presentation to advanced CAD user than a tutorial for newbies.
541,WID3009,Wow! It was such an inspiring journey!
542,WID3009,"The bi-weekly assignments mixed with the bi-weekly lessons is a really great course structure. The audio on some of the videos interviews can be poor, and I wish some lectures, especially the last one were more in depth, but over all great course with a good pace."
543,WID3009,Excellent course you should make more courses like this
544,WID3009,"it was really an amazing experience , wonderful course with a lot of knowledge to learn , a lot of facilitations that make studying process very interesting , thanks a lot for your efforts , I'm very enthusiastic to have a visit to the Leiden medical school and center one day ^_^ and continue to learn from such a great medical staff =D"
545,WID3009,I loved this course. I've been teaching Anatomy to physical therapist students for two years and this course helped me a lot to improve my teaching. Thank you for your hard work!
546,WID3009,Very interesting course! Great videos and instructors. T
547,WID3009,I'm so glad Leiden University is working with Coursera. Such a great course!
548,WID3009,"This is a great course, i am happy that you gave me the opprtunnity to get a certificate. Its a subject i really feel i gain more knowledge now."
549,WID3011,"Well-organised , Very good for beginners and intermediate learners ."
550,WID3014,no
551,WID3014,i never saw like this very very amazing worki would like to repeat this course 10 times
552,WIE3001,I love it ! Thanks for doing this for us
553,WIE3001,iam soooo happy to joined to this course which help me to evaluate my skills and increase it
554,WIE3001,A good refresher in abdominal anatomy. Though with some negatives. The accent was difficult to understand at first. Most of the course content is for beginners in undergraduate level. Yet it is still good.
555,WIE3007,Do you have an idea how lucky you are to have access to a course like this?! Normally you would have to be enrolled in med school.
556,WIE3007,Fantastic videos walking through anatomy on a real human body!
557,WIE3007,difficult course that is full of information but if anatomy is your 'thing' then this is a very good course to take.
558,WIE3007,incredible content and resources!
559,WIE3007,"I really want to thank you all! In fact ,i never have experienced that awsome lecture! The embryology is the most diffucule lesson to me,and through this lecture,I don't think it is boring and hard to understand.At the same time, I really acknowledge using what you have leraned is the coolist thing in the world.You can figure out how responsible the teachers are(include every individuals who participate in this lecture's making) !thank you all again!!"
560,WIE3007,-
561,WIE3007,"Tough course, but fascinating and very well presented. I was never going to pass the final test because I just do not need to know the detail. However, I'm very grateful to have got to the finish line. Thank you."
562,WIE3007,amazing course help me alot
563,WIE3007,"is a very very boring curse, don't recommend anyone, please for your good at everyboduy else kill this course, don't embarrass yourself and the universities that represents"
564,WIE3007,"Outstanding, clear, well-explained, not overwhelming. Dissections really aid to have a more realistic understanding. Good supplemental materials cover the material with great focus, and if more details are needed it is easy to get those elsewhere. Great effort by U. Leiden!"
565,WIE3007,it is a very good course escpecially for medical student
566,WIE3007,
567,WIE3007,Excellent!!! I am impressed; they explain very well and it is very interesting to learn from them despite their accent.
568,WIE3007,great course with great dissection videos. course materials are very interesting. I understood the anatomy of the abdomen which medical school couldn't teach me.
569,WIE3007,very hard course but extremely detailed one.
570,WIE3007,I am dropping this course. don't e-mail any more for this course. How do I unroll in this course.
571,WIE3007,"V difficult, but rewarding!I did not get the grade I thought I would in this class...but I learned a lot more than I thought I could! Very in depth and thorough, I think I value the knowledge I received more than the sub-par grade I received. ;)"
572,WIE3007,"The course itself is 10 out of 10: overwhelmingly informative, presented in a totally engaging manner, lots and lots of visual aids. Fly in the ointment: teaching assistants (called mentors here) apparently have come from very different (including hierarchical) societies and learners are required to take the mentors' diversified background and attitude into consideration. Not vice versa."
573,WIE3007,very hard but excellent course
574,WIE3007,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.
575,WIE3007,"Nice course, a difficult one but very challengeable. Nice structure and easy to understand.I wanted to refresh my knowledge in anatomy and in such gained a whole lot more in return.Thanks to the Professors for their time and effort in making this MOOC.Very pleased."
576,WIE3007,"Not meant for learners new to the medical field. Despite the challenges, the material is very fascinating and anyone interested in anatomy will learn something. The course utilizes outside research. I might enjoy the whole course experience more if the design were not so technical. I do, however, appreciate the challenge and seriousness of the topic."
577,WIE3007,"Great course, like the way of teaching. Really starts from noting and goes to a senior level of knowledge."
578,WIE3007,"Very good material, explainations and teachers. Recommended for everyone who wants to learn."
579,WIE3007,Im loving it so far.
580,WIE3007,"Very good course, still in the beginning, but liking so much."
581,WIE3007,Excellent course and well designed. Even though some of the concepts where harder for me to understand I now have a basic understanding of the structure of the abdomen.
582,WIE3007,Nice and necessary course.
583,WIE3007,Me gusto mucho
584,WIE3007,me gusto mucho
585,WIE3007,chevere
586,WIE3007,"I loved it, was very funny and relaxing."
587,WIE3007,"EXCELENTE CURSO.GRANDES TUTORASEXCELENTE METODOLOGIA DE ENSEÑANZA Y APRENDIZAJE.SE ABORDARON LOS TEMAS DE MANERA ENTENDIBLE, COMPRENSIBLE Y CON RETOS QUE INVITAN A RAZONAR Y APLICAR LOS CONOCIMIENTOS ADQUIRIDOS.ESPERO PIENSEN ELABORAR UNA SEGUNDA ETAPA DE INTERMEDIA Y AVANZADA"
588,WIE3007,So far the course is just a tutorial for using Scratch and they're not teaching how to program that is the name of the course.
589,WIE3007,Muy buen curso para aprender Scratch.
590,WIE3007,Very wonderful course to learn the basics of programming using the amusing and interactive language Scratch
591,WIE3007,"A course offering very accessible, clear introduction to the concept of programming seen as a network of algorithms, supplanted with a myriad of real-life examples. It then introduced a comely intuitive software, developed by MIT - Scratch, which enables you to practically start creating animations and thus programming. Even though i'm not a fluent hispano-hablante, just the knowledge of English and some classical culture should make it possible for you to follow. At the same time, should that be too complicated, there should be subtitles/English language version to all the videos and of all other materials. Have NOT tried that though."
592,WIE3007,Very easy and good explanations
593,WIE3007,
594,WIE3007,"The male Professors seem to speak Chinese half the time, therefore not being able to understand the material for students who aren't fluent in Chinese. I prefer the female Professor from Advanced Neurobiology I who presented the material in English, and in an engaging and coherent way."
595,WIE3007,"The topics are really interesting and advanced! However, there's a lot of talk in chinese, due to questions/answers from teacher and students, and the quizzes are a bit too easy. I learned a lot though."
596,WIE3008,"If you don't speak Chinese it's a terrible course...The lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained (at least the first week). The transcriptions into English are incomplete, so understand this course is very very complicated.I do not recommend it at all."
597,WIE3008,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!Really Advanced course with many many resources!
598,WIE3008,This course teaches us tips of effective and constructive way of discussing !
599,WIE3008,-
600,WIE3008,I like the way it's presented.
601,WIE3008,Great course and very great exercises
602,WIE3008,Great Course... Although I feel we must discuss more case studies
603,WIE3008,Very useful insights and definitely a knowledge enhancing course
604,WIE3008,"Very interesting, well- explained, and practical course. Unfortunately you need the Excel 2013 professional to complete it and make the most of it."
605,WIE3008,In depth step by step explanations in how to use Excel for Analysis and Visualization
606,WIE3008,"I have already had the basic skills in excel, but I learned many new things. The explanation was very clear and I enjoyed the lessons very much. At this moment, I cannot spend money for my own learning since I spend much money for the education of my child, but courser and pwc gave great opportunities for me to learn as an auditor."
607,WIE3008,Great Course. Lots of Analytics features from Excel... I love itttt
608,WIE3008,Good basic skills for creating clear and compelling graphs for visualizing data
609,WIE3008,-
610,WIE3008,Great!

612,WIE3008,A superb learning experience
613,WIE3008,Good course for understanding how to create advanced level of charts.
614,WIE3010,This course gave me the opportunity to learn a lot. Thanks to PwC
615,WIE3010,"Excellent course and it has opened my eyes to the wide array of Excel Power tools and their ability to provide simple, yet powerful visual dashboards for executive decision-making. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the course."
616,WIE3010,Useful information about Visualization in Excel and data presenting.
617,WIE3010,Very helpful! I have acquired a lot new skills from this course!
618,WIE3010,"Very good overview and practical exercises to keep learners focus. Exercises can be very technical, get ready to spend more time on it."
619,WIE3010,Very informative and more relevant than other courses for a business environment involving simulations of economic phenomena
620,WIE3010,I had not any ideas about powers of Excel! Thank you a lot!
621,WIE3010,"There are some excellent tools covered in this course. It is advanced level learning of Excel. There were a few glitches in the program. There was missing content at times. Overall, I was impressed with what the course covered."
622,WIE3010,A great course for people working with data
623,WIE3010,"Excellent course materials, very applicable for professionals who work with data"
624,WIE3010,"Practical, step-by-step guide and easy to understand, thank you very much for PwC instructor's efforts to design and develop such a fantastic course, look forward to completing the whole specialization!"
625,WIE3010,Very nice course and very helpful. It really helps to gain the in-depth visualization and analysis skills
626,WIE3010,"Great business practice advices, but not very rich with real life practice, like print preview, professional colour theme chosen, etc.Achieved: 2017-02-26"
627,WIF3005,"Hi,I am very excited about the course, thank you and your team for excellent overview of data analysis and visualisation tools in Excel. All videos are very consistent and contain very clear and informative message."
628,WIF3005,Good practical introduction! Good course.
629,WIF3005,Very useful and comprehensive
630,WIF3005,I really learned a lot during this course especially how to build data models and dashboards. Well worth the time spent.
631,WIF3005,Excellent materials and approach. It was a very useful course.
632,WIF3005,Great course to data analysis and excel!
633,WIF3005,Good one..!
634,WIF3005,having studied competitive strategy and now moving on with advanced strategy course. It illustrate more details to me which will help the work. Also the knowledge obtained involve lots of new ideas.

637,WIF3005,"Not difficult to understand,interesting,helpful when making choices."
638,WIF3005,very useful course. And thank for professor's clear instruction.
639,WIF3005,An interesting course and thank you for translating it.
640,WIF3006,The course is more about business competitive strategy and there are lots of live examples. Thumb up!
641,WIF3006,This course is very helpful to make me understand the economy and the finance th

644,WIF3006,tiada
645,WIF3006,"It was an excellent challenge that tested all my previous skill acquire along the specialization. I really enjoyed myself with this course. Give it a chance and do your best. Certainly, you will succeed.Cheers!"
646,WIF3006,"The course content is great, but peer evaluation is simply useless and almost random. This specialisation needs to introduce an actual final assessment by an actual expert, not peers."
647,WIF3006,Writing research paper is one of the most useful courses for all professionals.
648,WIF3006,I have learned so very much. All of the courses in the specialization have been taught in a way that has been easy to understand. I will miss Tamy Chapmans smiling face.
649,WIF3007,"I would love to thank you for your hard working. It was a good course. I have learnt a lot from you. In addition, I'm looking forward to participating with you on another course. Thank you once more again."
650,WIF3007,It is a great moment in my academic experience. Thank you Prof Tamy.
651,WIF3007,no comment
652,WIF3007,Terlalu banyak assignment
653,WIF3007,"Really insightful course giving a really amazing insight to the past political climate of the US, but also really shedding light on the current climate as well."
654,WIF3007,"I very much enjoyed learning more about Thomas Jefferson through the required readings and Professor Onuf's lectures, and would recommend this course to anyone wanting to know more about the third president of the United States and the University of Virginia. My time was well-spent."
655,WIF3007,"Excellent class! This is an overview of who Jefferson was, what he really thought and believed in, what his contradictions were and why they existed, and how the perception of him has changed through different historical periods. I thought I knew a reasonable amount of information about Jefferson and the revolutionary period, but I learned so much about the historical and cultural context of the time and how it shaped Jefferson's thoughts!Given our current judicial system's split over whether the constitution should be regarded according to the 'originalist' intention or whether it is a living document, I was surprised to find that Jefferson himself saw it as a living document, to be reshaped by each generation. Understanding why he thought that is really essential to understanding how to think about the problem today. So this isn't just history, it's current events!I was concerned that the course seemed to be all lecture, but by the second week I was hooked. Dr Onuf is a compelling speaker, and tries to convey who Jefferson was, the world he existed in, and get you to think about Jefferson in all his complexity. The reading material is all pertinent, and (thank you!) not overwhelming. This course is ""right-sized"" for an online forum. I think you could spend about an our or maybe two per week on the lectures and reading material, and do fine. You would do yourself a favor to view each lecture twice though, as there is a lot of material in each one.I would consider retaking the course for review, and would definitely take another course from Dr. Onuf. This was terrific, and I don't say that lightly."
656,WIF3007,"Exciting presentation. Excellent portrial of the periodic changes in thinking of TJ with his rise, fall and revival. While a conroversial thinker he truly was a renaissance men that will inspire future generations. America would not be exceptional, nor even a free country, empowed by the people."
657,WIF3007,"My only recommendation would be to add more photos, maps, illustrations, etc to the lectures, instead of twenty minutes of the camera pointed at the professor. It would help keep the attention of the viewer, in my opinion."
658,WIF3007,The course is really nicely done. Also for non-americans it is interesting even though a lot of background knowledge might be missing. But you have to be aware it is really more focused on the ideas of Jefferson and less on all the discussions and fights he had with his fellow statesmen at that time. I would have wished to learn also more about those.
659,WIF3008,"Great Course! A profound analysis of Jefferson ideal and wish for the nation to be. This course demonstrate how great, clever and wise Jefferson was. Now I can better understand what JFK said during a Nobel prize winner reunion at the White House: This is the highest concentration of intelligent in this house since Jefferson had dinner alone. Thank you for sharing this course on the net."
660,WIG3008,"Excellent course! I learned so much about Jefferson, and I appreciate Dr. Onuf's expertise on the subject."
661,WIH3003,Great lecture series on Jefferson's civic thoughts and writings.
662,WIH3003,The lectures are so thought-provoking and enlightening... Thank you very much!
663,WIH3003,Fantastic course by Dr. Onuf! I learned much and he helped correct misconceptions I harbored regarding Thomas Jefferson. Great videos and selected readings. The quizzes were relatively challenging.
664,WIH3003,Very Thankful for this course...
665,WIH3003,I loved the tour of the campus. It fit the material and made it seem more like a college setting than watching lectures on a screen in a class room all the time.
666,WIH3003,This is everything a Coursera course should be! Amazing videos and lectures that are well organized.
667,WIH3003,"I already love this and not just because Jefferson is my life long love affair, nice."
668,WIH3003,"Really interesting to get such a deep perspective on Jefferson. I had very little interest in him, even growing up in his home state of Virginia, but now I can't wait to learn more. This is a great course worth a fantastic instructor. Highly recommended!"
669,WIH3003,I take my hat off for the passionate professor Onuf. It was a big pleasure to attend his lectures. They deepened my understanding of the American Revolution.
670,WIH3003,"I was terribly disappointed in this course. Mr. Onuf spends the majority of these lectures implying what Jefferson thinks without discussing much in the way of actual history. Further, the course seems more of a commercial for the University of Virginia than anything else. Overall, a waste of time."
671,WIX1001,Great course
672,WIX1001,Fantastic stuff for anyone interesting in the subject matter.
673,WIX1001,I found the course interesting and very stimulating. It allowed insight into a very interesting period in world history.
674,WIX1001,outstanding prof
675,WIX1001,Exceptional course! I would have enjoyed several more weeks. Dr. Onuf's style and methods in presenting the material made it possible to understand Jefferson in a way I have not understood him before. Wonderful teacher. Thank you.
676,WIX1001,Really interesting and enjoyable course.
677,WIX1001,
678,WIX1001,
679,WIX1001,very informative
680,WIX1001,"As a former student of UVA, it was wonderful to see the place again, listen to some of the stories we heard around ""grounds"" -- no campus here -- back when I was a teenager. I have followed Jefferson's life story, but Professor Onuf still manages to tell me some things I didn't know. Well researched lectures."
681,WIX1001,"Being Australian, I knew nothing about Jefferson so I came to this course with no expectations. I found it fascinating as it explained not only about Jefferson but about the American model of Government and Americans unique view of their nation. It is sometimes puzzling to an outsider to see this super nationalism and allegiance to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. As an aside, I wonder what Jefferson would think of the apparent obsession with the literal words of the Founding Fathers with respect to things like gun control. Very interesting indeed.Mr Onuf is an excellent lecturer. You brought the topic aliveThanks"
682,WIX1001,Great Course
683,WIX1001,I knew nothing about Jefferson before this course and nothing about his 'age' - not sure I am much the wiser about the latter after it! I enjoyed the tours round the historic sites and I thought the lecturer came over as warm and enthusiastic but it seemed he was preaching about a saint rather than giving a detached academic assessment of a historical figure and I found that it was hard to see the wood for the trees at times. Hagiographic might be an unkind description but it was certainly very respectful to the great man. I also liked the use of a student in cooperation with the lecturer.- he set the scene well and was a good interviewer.
684,WIX1001,The lectures are just videos of the professor bloviating about Jefferson. There is nothing academic about this course.
685,WIX1001,Useful orientation for a good American who more or less slept through all of his American hx courses in his callow youth. I have a much better sense of the important (if controversal) role Jefferson played in forming the values and structure of the US.
686,WIX1001,
687,WIX1001,Terima kasih Dr
688,WIX1001,"Great course that take you nicely through the intricacies of agile planning for software products. The instructors are knowledgeable and the material is good. The videos cover a lot, but the complementary cours notes and the supplemental resources makes it easy to review and use the material in practice during actual work situations."
689,WIX1001,"Lots of well structured content, easy to follow and informative. You know it's the tip of a large iceberg, so it's a very good way to start and let you wanting for more."

697,WIX1001,Really like this course! I think it is the best one in this specialization. Thank you all!
698,WIX1001,"Tons of great info! However, it would great to go over more of the real-life applications of the concepts."
699,WIX1001,Great course
700,WIX1001,That course is great! All material is described in easy form. I like very my tasks that had to be done and then put marks by other students.
701,WIX1001,It is very full package of knowledge and tests. I have a lot of new opportunities due to this course. Thank you.
702,WIX1001,It is excellent course in terms of the knowledge that I gain. However the multiple choice questions are a little bit default to understand. It is look like that you are examining our English skill :)
703,WIX1001,"Really helpful course! Thanks, Coursera!"
704,WIX1001,It is great learning experience..
705,WIX1001,
706,WIX1001,This course has helped me increase my knowledge and skills in project planning using Agile.
707,WIX1001,Pretty good.. A bit tough compared to the rest though.
708,WIX1001,As usual for this specs - a very high quality course.
709,WIX1001,"Great examples used in course videos. The Course Notes might be a worked on a bit more in terms of models and examples, but they are quite extensive and an invaluable resource. Teaching staff is quick to respond to forum questions, which is great!"
710,WIX1001,"Quite interesting, may be not deep enough but great course nevertheless!"
711,WIX1001,Full of new information on agile planning!
712,WIX1001,great course
713,WIX1001,"The most robust course in this sequence. It is well designed, very clear, teaches useful material effectively, and is fun to take."
714,WIX1001,Very easy to understand.
715,WIX1001,I think some estimation methods are not really realistic
716,WIX1001,
717,WIX1001,Another great course in the specialization! great instructors who are very passionate. Truly make it fun and interesting to learn.
718,WIX1001,Great course
719,WIX1001,"My least favorite part of the course, but it was still put together well. Content just isn't as interesting as the rest of the specialization. Felt a bit too ""Project Manager' instead of the Product Manager."
720,WIX1001,It's very usefull course
721,WIX1001,Was great course.
722,WIX1001,Great course! Very useful information for beginners and for those who already has an experience with agile planning.
723,WIX1001,"Some part of learning material not concern to agile planning, for exampe absolutly not mentioned kanban planing."
724,WIX1001,This is a good series course to coach Agile process with generic pro
725,WIX1001,Really enjoyed t
726,WIX1001,Makes lots of things understandable and clear
727,WIX1001,Good Course.
728,WIX1001,"One of the best coursers I have seen on Coursera so far. The video production quality, course structure and content is extra ordinary compared to other courses that I've seen so far."
729,WIX1001,Very nice content and presented so nicely. Must read and highly recommended course for all managers and business analysts.
730,WIX1001,"I am Krishna Kant Kumar, working as a software quality analyst.Through this course, I learnt, how to estimate an iteration or doing an estimation of project."
731,WIX1001,Ambiguous assignments led to cumbersome completion. The peer grading got a little annoying as sometimes it took forever to get feedback and a lot of times feedback was minimal or the criteria for grading was vague and people took it WAY too seriously.
732,WIX1001,"Not the best, but if you are a newbie in management field you can find valuable information inside."
733,WIX1001,I highly recommend this entire specialisation. It's clearly taught and requires your practical application throughout. I've learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed the process. Many many thanks Uni of Alberta.
734,WIX1001,Room for improvement:-Case studies-More Assignment
735,WIX1001,Thanks!
736,WIX1001,"As a software-engineer and freelancer in the technical software domain, for me this course actually had all the meat (so far) while the first courses in the specialization felt like they didn't take that much effort to pass."
737,WIX1001,"Very useful to know different tecniques for software project/productplanning. Although some of those tecniques are (in my opinion) notvery relevant in an Agile environment (like work breakdown structures,pert or gant charts) the course is good to learn how to use those toolsand also to ask ourselves whether or not they are actually relevant or useful if we follow the Agile approach."
738,WIX1001,I really liked to do it
739,WIX1001,The course materials and lectures are excellent
740,WIX1001,N/A
741,WIX1001,Awesome lectures! Thanks a lot!
742,WIX1001,Great course! Thank you!
743,WIX1001,"Super-duper, very useful!"
744,WIX1001,"This course has the minimal information than its brother courses, you may need to add more details focus on the planning more and give more assignment if applicable."
745,WIX1001,tiada
746,WIX1001,Good Course
747,WIX1001,Nice course. Decent content and always well-structured lectures. The peer assignments could have been better though.
748,WIX1001,This is more enlightening than the previous courses in the specialization. It felt like learning new material and techniques rather than simply reviewing concepts I already knew. I also liked that the assignments required creating actual artifacts and reviewing others' work. The industry interviews were a nice addition as well.
749,WIX1001,tiada
750,WIX1001,"Very tough, though very instructive."
751,WIX1001,I think ti is a very interesting and well structured course.
752,WIX1001,"I am participating in this course, it has an excellent material, I am learning new skills in writing an article research."
753,WIX1001,Very interesting course
754,WIX1001,"The course has enhanced my reading experience. Writing in the margins… up till now I have never challenged or asked the writer any questions. This idea has never struck me before, but interacting with texts provides ""room"" on the page for my conversation with the writer, which is a visual reminder that all texts are part of an ongoing discussion and are not the last word on a given subject.Thank you, Prof. Bazanova!"
755,WIX1001,It's a very interesting and useful course. It significantly improves my reading and writting skills. Thank you very much!
756,WIX1001,"interesting, informative and useful. I quite like the self-questioning part which makes publication reading more effortless. Thanks."
757,WIX1001,It's a both very interesting and useful course for everyone who's planning to broaden the skills of a scentific writings in a quite involving and systematic manner.
758,WIX1001,Very interesting and useful course!
759,WIX1001,Thank you for your course. I improved my academic literacy skills. I still have to continue to improve but now I'm on the right track!
760,WIX1001,"The course is excellent! Straight to the point, both professors can explain the subject in a very easy way. The course was a pleasant surprise!! I strongly recommend!"
761,WIX1001,Looking forward to course 3!
762,WIX1001,"Excellent course with very supportive staff and professors on the forum. On top of that aligning the assignments to ""The Romance of Three Kingdoms"" story makes it fun to follow along."
763,WIX1001,Very good course and excelent teachers!
764,WIX1001,Fantastic course material from great professionals!
765,WIX1001,"Really useful, focused and motivating. Hihgly recommended!"
766,WIX1002,all good
767,WIX1001,Was a really good course which provided me useful knowledge for my postgraduate course.
768,WIX1001,"Excellent, educational and witty lectures! One of the best classes on Coursera."
769,WIX1001,
770,WIX1001,Great Course and the professor is great!
771,WIX1001,I love this dude; very entertaining professor who is easy to understand. The class itself was also very interesting and i learned a lot that i can apply to my current position as a senior analyst at an industry research firm.
772,WIX1002,N/A
773,WIX1001,"Easy to follow, good content and comprehensive explanations"
774,WIX1001,Course and examples are generally good. In rare instances the quiz has answers it labells 'correct' which I think could be debated.
775,WIX1001,Interesting course. Valuable insights into network effects.
776,WIX1001,"Excellent course, an excellent professor!!!!, Many thanks!!!"
777,WIX1001,A nice course for the opics concluded from the base course.
778,WIX1001,THANK YOU!
779,WIX1001,"Excellent course, professor tobias teachs so good!"
780,WIX1001,"The course was really great! The teacher explained excellent and the topics were very appropiate. However, when i finished the course i couldn't see the certificate of accomplishment at least; it never showed up :( And now when i click on the option ""Buy the course"" the page redirects me to an address which doesn't exist.Despite of this, I enjoyed this course a lot, as the first one! Thanks a lot!"
781,WIX1001,Terrific course! Terrific instructor! I wish he had provided a learning path for ppl who completed this though...
782,WIX1001,Very interesting and full of real case study.
783,WIX1001,Great add-on to the first eddition of the course on Business Strategy. Congratulations to the Professor Tobias and his crew.
784,WIX1001,This is one of the best courses. The manner of teaching is very lucid and easy to understand. I am impressed with the examples. I would love to have more courses from him on Competitive Strategy!! Cheers!
785,WIX1001,"It's the best course, on which I have ever been enrolled. Its language is understandable not only for students of economic departments and for everyone, who is interested in this topic. The professor is a professional in his sphere and just a talented person with an actor's skills. He turned the course into an interesting tour of Munich, because every module is connected with some sight of the city, this activates attention and makes teaching material more remembered. If this course is continued, I will definitely join it! Thank you)"
786,WIX1002,Exceptional training course for those working in the field of market strategy etc. Explanation and examples are close to the actual world.
787,WIX1002,The best free strategy course!
788,WIX1003,
789,WIX1002,Awesome lecture. I wish the lectures at my University would have been as good as this. Then I think I would have a much better and more interesting time and I`d learned a lot more.Thanks for all your work!!Best wishes form Switzerland!
790,WIX1002,nice one to get into the strategy of any kind of the competionsyou could pass it even if you didn't go through the Part1anyhow it will be more then useful to understand the basis
791,WIX1002,excellent and some hint of humour in an otherwise rather arid topic!thanks
792,WIX1002,This a great course. I recommend it to anyone. Also make sure to take the previous course. The exams are great way to fixate knowledge.
793,WIX1002,"One of the best online course i have ever taken, i seriously reccomend this course to all those people who are into business and management."
794,WIX1002,"Very informative with plenty of real-life (or credible fictional) examples to better understand the concepts that were introduced. The pace was agreeable and the subjects diverse. Special mention should go to the instructor (Prof. Tobias Kretschmer), who did a terrific job! I liked the question format as well, though it could have been more challenging by not giving away the answers after an end-of-module quiz even if you didn't pass. That being said, the course is well worth 5 stars!"
795,WIX1002,"Actually, the course should be titled as ""Introduction Into Macroeconomics"", I think. The course is fine, but I won't call it really ""advanced"" one. The structure and topic list is okay, but the depth is not enough to threat the course as ""advanced""."
796,WIX1002,Absolutely useful! They make it so easy to understand and probably the best MOOC I´d ever apply for
797,WIX1002,N/A
798,WIX1002,Just love it
799,WIX1002,Love your style of teaching. The Multiple choice answers in your exams are difficult but necessary to fully understand the topics.Content of the course - 100/100.I would take another course of Prof. Kretschmer instantly.
800,WIX1002,Well structured course! The explanation was clear and I have the frame works in my mind when I finish the course! Helpful course!
801,WIX1002,"Honestly, for something that says ""Advanced"" in the title, I thought it was a little too basic. There isn't enough depth and a lot of it involves common sense. Perhaps a more case-study driven course would have been interesting with more qualitative, essay responses required rather than cut-and-dry multiple-choice."
802,WIX1002,"content was not as interesting as in the first course, but still good overall. Questions were also less analytical challenging as the first course. But I still enjoyed the course as the professor was explaining the subject clearly and the videos were compact and enjoyable."
803,WIX1002,"Overall, this is a good subject.However, some slides are not well organized.Many questions in assignment are too tricky."
804,WIX1002,Fascinating material. Thanks again!
805,WIX1002,"Great professor, interesting course."
806,WIX1002,"while the task of summing up a lot of information in a minimum sized presentation is always a very difficult task, the structure of the material presented was not optimal. This in turn made it difficult for me personally to actually connect the weekly information presented with the overall meaning and the objective of each module. The ""why"" and ""how"" of most modules fit to the meaning we are forming (up to week 5 -the point I am leaving this class) is not evident. Last, some of the questions contained ambiguities that could not be reasonably clarified even going back and reviewing the material of the specific segment. Thank you for the offered class in any case."
807,WIX1002,"Varied and well-explained that held my interest throughout. My only criticism is the English in some of the written quizzes, especially in the final exam, needs reviewing by native speaker as some of the answers are ambiguous when they do not properly explain the context of the situation."
808,WIX1002,One of the best courses on Coursera.
809,WIX1002,Awesome course! I learned a lot through this journey. Thanks very much for providing this course.
810,WIX1002,Amazing course.
811,WIX1002,"Good course, Hope we had a certification for this."
812,WIX1002,"One suggestion would be lest multiple option answers, but the course was challenging enough to learn valuable information."
813,WIX1002,Very useful course and extremely well presented. Would recommend it.
814,WIX1002,World-class
815,WIX1002,-
816,WIX1002,"Very good course, but it is not ""advanced strategy""."
817,WIX1002,Very informative and I learned a lot
818,WIX1002,Valuable sequel to course Competitive Strategy by the same author. Interesting and informative.
819,WIX1002,"it is well put and easy to understand. besides, you can learn it anytime. the content is enlightening and has many new and intestesting topics. i really like it ."
820,WIX1002,"This course is not only well structured, but truly enjoyable with the various outdoor background"
821,WIX1002,"It was a great course, however some of the quiz answers are debatable"
822,WIX1002,"After completing this course, I have gained valuable insights in real life situations and be more aware in my own industry. This course would not only allow you to see the playing field but also to make carefully calculated decisions towards the best possible outcome.The tests are difficult and some are rather tricky. But hey, the situations we encounter in real life are far worse than these."
823,WIX1002,"Material was tough, some of the questions weren't easy to understand / process. But overall a great class."
824,WIX1002,Very Good!
825,WIX1002,"While the course was overall well developed, there are certain language challenges to overcome especially with understanding the wording of quizzes. I got a number of questions wrong simply because I could not understand the phrasing, and lack of explanations on quizzes makes for a lot of difficulty to evaluate progress. And I get the reason for not including answer explanations, at the same time I'm literally comparing answers to the module transcripts and could not possibly infer multiple choice answers based off how the topic was explained. I would suggest more definitive questions and reduce multiple choice questions or at least define the question in a more narrow, specified manner to minimize confusion. I'm taking this course for fun, I have an MBA and love strategy, so the topics are not new by any means, but if I can't understand what you're trying to say I would imagine non-business backgrounds would find the questions very difficult."
826,WIX1002,it was great learning such interesting issues
827,WIX1002,"Nice addition to the ""Competitive Strategy"" course, although not as interesting and practical as the first part... Cases and current examples would have made this section much better.Prof. Tobias Kretschmer ... 5 starsCompetitive Strategy . . . 5 starsAdvanced Competitive Strategy ... 3 stars"
828,WIX1002,An easy to understand and very resourceful course with ample examples. Would love to enroll into similar courses.
829,WIX1002,Awesome concept to learn
830,WIX1002,very Insightful
831,WIX1002,"It's a very good course, with fabolous material, examples and style"
832,WIX1002,5 stars! Great University !! Enjoyed and learned!
833,WIX1002,Perfect professor!
834,WIX1002,"I'm so happy to make it! I learnt so much about academic writing, thanks!"
835,WIX1002,I have learnt alot from this course
836,WIX1002,Very good course for writing in a systematic way.
837,WIX1002,no comment
838,WIX1002,Excellent course for whom really wants to boost his/her writing skills.
839,WIX1002,Enjoyed this course very much. Thank you.
840,WIX1002,"This is not an easy course, but once you finish it, your academic writing skills are going to improve considerably, Best!"
841,WIX1002,perfect course to get perfection in writing
842,WIX1002,"It says 'advanced writing' but it is advanced for college students, not advanced overall. I found it extremely basic."
843,WIX1002,Great Course I like it a lot. I learn new things for my research
844,WIX1002,You need to check out his course.
845,WIX1002,I learned how to write different types of essays.
846,WIX1002,Pretty good!
847,WIX1002,Thank you so much Prof. Chapman!
848,WIX1002,"Very helpful, at least, for me."
849,WIX1002,Such amazing course work on developing the writing skills in a decent way.
850,WIX1002,The perfect brainstorming exercise for academic essay writing !
851,WIX1002,"It helps you build your essay-writing muscles gradually. Too much emphasis on plagiarism. Some flaws in the grading forms. The level of the participants is quite mixed, most feedback they give is useless (""good"")."
852,WIX1002,Great course and teachers
853,WIX1002,I really love this cause. My writing skills is really impoving. I like my peers their reviews.it really train me on writing well.
854,WIX1002,Will try it out soon. Looks very promising and informative.
855,WIX1002,"it is okay, not what I expected, but okay."
856,WIX1002,I hope that this course could be free because I can't afford 69 dollars for th
857,WIX1002,I enjoyed a lot taking this course. It also represented a challenge to me.
858,WIX1002,It's really useful!
859,WIX1002,I found it very useful
860,WIX1002,Exellent course. You will learn the advanced skills for a better understanding of the English languaje.
861,WIX1003,-
862,WIX1002,This course is awesome.
863,WIX1002,"The course is fine as far as content. My complaint is that there is no one to contact regarding papers or questions. You are left to the other students for your grading and assignment completion, meaning that some of your assignments can hang there for weeks before ever getting reviewed."
864,WIX1002,very useful course.
865,WIX1002,An absolutely wonderful course! I learned a lot about advanced essay writing. I think it is a must-take course for those who are interested in writing academic and research essays!
866,WIX1002,Not the course id think it would be.I learn less information than i d expect but these were still usefull information.
867,WIX1002,Loved it!
868,WIX1002,well explained informative course
869,WIX1003,-
870,WIX1002,This course helped me improve my writing skills.
871,WIX1002,Great course :)
872,WIX1002,This course has set me free from my fear of expressing my ideas and opinions in writing.
873,WIX1002,Great course
874,WIX1002,I have learned a lot in this course. Ordinary English courses don't cover the topics we have studied here.
875,WIX1002,Great !!!!
876,WIX1002,"This was a great class for review of what I learned years ago. I only wish I could have participated in the assignments w/o purchasing the class, as I have been able to in all of my other classes. But, I loved the class and would recommend it."
877,WIX1002,"Fantastic! Good work that the teacher can compact the course section to less than 10-minute videos each week, and it is clear. Easy to grasp . . . help a lot for my initial study! MLA format and work cited page are great too . . . thanks!"
878,WIX1002,It was really useful. From now on I will start applying everything I've learn in my collage tasks.
879,WIX1002,Great learning experience .
880,WIX1002,Thank you for everything!
881,WIX1002,"Great Course, in particular to students whose tongue are not English."
882,WIX1002,Very useful and professional!
883,WIX1002,Very easy steps to learn. lot of assignments to practice. Good work.Thank you.
884,WIX1002,It's wonderful and useful.
885,WIX1002,"One of the best courses by Coursera, it significantly helps me increase my writing skill."
886,WIX1002,"great, thank you :)"
887,WIX1002,Perfect
888,WIX1002,"It has good content, but there were missing classes to give more advices or clear any question students have, when grading peer review homeworks there were plenty of mistakes that would have been avoided if there were more video lectures or forums with teachers."
889,WIX1002,"From this 1.5 month course, I learned far more than I did from the 4-year on-campus studying. Of course, the level of the universities in my country is not nearly as that of the US; nevertheless, in the single combat ""Adv.Writing course against a ""Bachelor's degree"", the latter sustains a crushing defeat!"
890,WIX1002,Advanced Writing is a course that challenges the best English learner. You apply what you've learned so far and things get more formal.
891,WIX1002,This course has a lot of tools to learn the writing art.
892,WIX1002,through this course i was able to right effectively on some complex topics which was what i was hoping for. Thanks a lot to the instructor Tamy Chapman whose video lectures were excellent in content and quality.
893,WIX1002,"I wasn't sure what to expect with the Advanced Writing course. Again, peer review was unnecessarily harsh because people don't understand the flexibility and nuance of writing, but it's definitely informative and has made me a more mature academic writer. This specialization is well worth it, for the videos alone. The instructor is clear and the videos are very concise."
894,WIX1002,It would be extremely useful to me as it is teaching me techniques to write advanced-level essays.
895,WIX1002,"It is detailed, rigorous, and exciting! The teacher's presentations in video materials are interesting as well!"
896,WIX1002,great course thnx
897,WIX1002,Wonderful course!
898,WIX1002,I have learnt so much for doing this course. I have recommended the course to friends and families.
899,WIX1002,so good. must be engaged
900,WIX1002,It is so beneficial for international students who have been prepared on TOEFL iBT or IELTS.
901,WIX1002,"taking Essay writing first, cannot unenroll from this course at this"
902,WIX1002,"Firstly, I would love to introduce myself to you. I'm Suliman from Libya. I'm Teaching Assistant at the University of Benghazi. Secondly, I would love to thank you so much for your hard working and for this wonderful course. Thank you once more."
903,WIX1002,The course is highly effective!
904,WIX1002,"I learn a lot from this class so far, but I'm having difficult for the Quiz, i know i should take some notes, hahaha"
905,WIX1002,Another well structured course that provided challenges to help impove essay writing techniques. Thanks you.
906,WIX1002,"It is not very ""advanced"""
907,WIX1002,"At this point, I think that the course is good, however there should be more reviews. Three reviews of people who is also learning is not enough, in my opinion. I have received some comments like 'some sentences are not good'. Which tells me absolutely nothing. I think people should be encouraged to exemplify what they mean ,to take the sentences that they believe that are wrong, and extend why.For the rest, the course is very good."
908,WIX1002,helped in my phd writing thesis
909,WIX1002,"I am in love for this course, a lot of good information, practice activities, etc...It is helping me a lot!"
910,WIX1003,N/A
911,WIX1002,nice things to do and good examples.
912,WIX1002,Fantastic and fun!
913,WIX1002,This advanced writing course illustrates how to writing a longer college essay and guides students all over the world to start their very first writing piece.
914,WIX1002,"Extremely poor quality of instruction. The lectures themselves are little more than the material being read directly off the slides by an individual with a poor grasp on the English language. The majority of the slides are walls of unclear and non-descriptive text. Even with reading directly from the slides, the lecturer is overly circumstantial in her explanations if not just outright tangential. I commend the authors for putting together a course outside of their native language but, in this case at least, it does more harm than good.In short, this course has the air of a group of first year students giving a presentation verbatim from the slides, as another commenter also mentioned below."
915,WIX1002,"This course is a discreditation to coursera, and it's low standards are appalling. From a purely certificate based perspective, the only requirement to complete the course are completely the quizzes. They are short, and can easily be googled, or the slides can be downloaded and the answers simply CRTL+F for keyboards. There is zero need to watch the lectures ( at least for the first 2 weeks).The lectures are terrible themselves. The English is beyond horrible, and I don't understand the modern culture of having teachers teach in languages they can't speak. It is purely reading off the slides in any case, word for word. I learned more about the basics in neuroscience in a 20 minutes lecture from a separate course, ""Computational Neuroscience"" than the entire first week here.If you actually want to learn neuroscience, check out HardvardX's intro course."
916,WIX1003,
917,WIX1002,easily understood
918,WIX1002,"This is the worst, most pathetic course I have taken online. If Peking University believes this is their best - I'll not be taking another course with them. The instructor's command of the English language is awful and the sub-titles are some help, but not a lot. Instructors are just talking faces up front - they cannot teach. They may be great in the lab, but keep them out of the classroom. I toughed out the course, but it only got worse. I had originally signed up for parts 1 and 2 of this course. Canceled part 2. The use of slides that are not clear / too small and not on the screen long enough to digest the information did not help. Do yourself a favor - avoid this course. As a side note - I have taken in excess of 25 online courses, this was the most painful."
919,WIX1002,Very good Course!! Thank You.
920,WIX1002,Very boring... The professor is just reading (with a bad English). The illustrations are also very boring...
921,WIX1002,The professor is reading long texts. It is not really attractive.
922,WIX1002,"I greatly enjoyed the material presented in this course and while I do not doubt the proficiency of it's creators the poor standard of spoken English of its two main presenters prevents me from recommending it to colleagues. As another reviewer has remarked, their English may be quite sufficient for day to day use with other experts but for inadequate for teaching students who are hearing many technical terms for the first time. The transcripts are no better and also contain many mistakes. I believe that this course should be stopped until these problems are corrected."
923,WIX1002,"Very excellent course, I learned a lot. It lets me know the development process of the neuro-science and also the heros in it. My major is alternative splicing, I wish other life science branches can have this kinds of course too."
924,WIX1002,"The professors sound like a group of first-year students presenting a group project, literally reading notes off of a powerpoint slide. The professors also can't speak English, so instead of explaining things in depth, they have to very, very slowly read basic phrases (to explain complex subject matter) off of what's basically a teleprompter."
925,WIX1002,"The course presented a lot of interesting, fascinating information. I especially liked the first female lecturer. However, there were some problems with downloading the course slide presentations and questions were never answered in the forum discussion groups. In addition, the second lecturer, although very interesting, often did not talk about the material that was presented on exams. I also think integrating a lot more animation to describe different processes would be effective so that students can visualise the content."
926,WIX1002,Dr. Li is a wonderful teacher! I love his style very much!
927,WIX1002,Accurate and clear.
928,WIX1002,thank you for opening ideas in the world of neurobiology I have learned a lot so far and I'm sure I will learn much more with you ..greetings from Guayaquil-Ecuador
929,WIX1002,"So far the topics are very interesting but the accent of the teacher is sooo difficult to follow and distracts me! Also, she is looking down to read all the time and this doesn't reflect her knowledge."
930,WIX1002,"Really poor powerpoint presentations and videos, half in chinese. The accent of the teacher is horrible (i'm not an english-native speaking person so it's hard for me to follow english when badly spoken, so i cut off the sound and only read the subtitles.)The content is interesting though."
931,WIX1002,"Is a good course, with a comprenhensible material and resourses. I think they should improve the quility of video-classes and some teachers doesn´t have good english pronunciation."
932,WIX1002,Fascinating course but a little too much math for my taste.
933,WIX1002,"I don't want to be mean, but the first week was terrible! I was expecting what it said: ADVANCED neurobiology.I feel bad giving this review. I'm just dropping the course."
934,WIX1002,"After finishing week 1, I have decided to stick with Duke university's Medical neuroscience which is starting up again. I also highly recommend ""Understanding the Brain The Neurobiology of Everyday Life"" which I believe was taught by the University of Chicago. I found them to be far more engaging the viewer and the format to be much easier to follow. I found it visually disturbing and also have to keep pausing to read the slide before it switches.It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this course. It also seemed she had trouble pronouncing many of the words and I do not want to learn how to pronounce many of them incorrectly also many of the slides did not have an English translation on them."
935,WIX1002,Great course! I loved the teachers!
936,WIX1002,"I find this to be a very nice and stimulating course. The teachers are enthusiastic and entertaining. The course material (slides, quizzes, captions) needs to be polished, but the general organization of the course is logical, clear, and systematic. The course presents an experimentalist's view of the subject, which I find very good considering that much related Coursera material is quite theoretical. There are plenty of historical notes and introductions of general neurobiology research viewpoints (don't miss the excellent bonus material interviews!). In particular, I enjoyed the ""cherry picking"" metaphor. Some students have had problems with the instructors' accent, but perhaps because English is not my first language, this has not been a problem for me at all. I'm looking forward to part two of the course!"
937,WIX1002,"This course is useless and perhaps even harmful.The professors would have done much better if they had taught the class in their native Chinese language and then got a really good translator to make subtitles in English.I tried turning off the sound and just watching the presentation while reading the subtitles, but even this was so badly done in terms of language and presentation, that although I desperately wanted to take a course in advanced neurobiology, I felt that this course could actually destroy my love for the subject or teach me things that are incorrect because of language mistakes.If you are not a native speaker of English then by all means steer even further clear as you will learn some very bad English habits and pronunciation.I'm sure the profs' English ability is fine for collaborating with other professionals who already know the material, but teaching in English was a big mistake.Again, I highly suggest they re-do the entire thing in Chinese and get really good translations and subtitles made and then I think it could be an awesome course. Now, as is, it would be truly foolish to take this course."
938,WIX1002,Boring and can't make sense of the presentation / language and idiom use.
939,WIX1002,"before discussing genetic mutations occurred in Alzheimer disease that mentioned when discussing AIS, i think some refreshment about protein synthesis and the normal pattern that if disturbed by certain ways as mutations causes particular diseases.some arrangements of material needed to prevent information overlappinginteresting courses, go onthanks for your efforts dear professors"
940,WIX1002,"Lots of good information, but the presentation is very bad. Not only are the professors clearly struggling with the English (and the material, calling anatomical planes ""plates"" and confounding sulci with fissures, etc), but some of the recording/video editing decisions make it less engaging and more difficult to follow. For example, the size of the images is often compromised because they chose to show the professor on the left side of the screen, even though it is absolutely unnecessary to do so.Overall, I do not recommend this course."
941,WIX1002,"Great course, much to learn in a short time but with an excellent guide."
942,WIX1002,Me gusto
943,WIX1002,Application assignment is a must-do for students taking this course. The second computer network application is very a rewarding one for me to finish with gains on concepts of graph as well as programming stretch with my hands dirty.
944,WIX1002,great course
945,WIX1002,"coursea does not allow me to quit the class. Also, I cannot do the homework or watch video at my own pace."
946,WIX1002,"Great class, very well constructed. Professors are very knowledgeable and the course materials are well designed. I started from the very beginning of the class knowing very little about python and algorithm, by this class I'm pretty comfortable coding in python. And I got to apply what I've learned in my interview for jobs. Definitely a great class! Learned a lot, and still applying it in my job."
947,WIX1002,"Compared to the previous courses in this specialization I found this a tough course. Calculating the big-O for yourself wasn't easy. The descriptions of the applications #1 and #2 were not very clear to me at the start (probably because English is not my first language). Some sentences I had to read several times before I understand what was asked. But the things I learned are useful and I am definitely sure that what I have learned here I can use in my work as software engineer. Thank you Luay, Scott and Joe for another excellent course."
948,WIX1002,"Too much bla, bla, bla. Very slowly, very boring."
949,WIX1002,A course I enjoy very much!
950,WIX1002,"The applications were too time consuming. Please consider adding a tool that makes graphing easier. The course itself was very good and engaging and without us knowing it, would teach core fundamentals of computing through the coding exercises."
951,WIX1002,"It takes some serious dedication to understand and apply the material if math and computation are foreign to you, like they were for me. But if you apply that dedication, the material is accessible and the feeling of accomplishment is tremendous. Great class/teaching."
952,WIX1002,optimization and fragmentation..algos arithmos olokliroma..fractal resilience..
953,WIX1002,"One of the best course offered by coursera, helps you to develop very strong basics if new,."
954,WIX1002,"Project is interesting, bu the video lecture is kind of repetitive and does not cover much"
955,WIX1002,"The transition from the original Coursera platform to the new one has significantly reduced my overall satisfaction with the course experience (I have previously taken the 4 earlier Rice courses in this series and enjoyed them immensely).Major contributing factors to my dissatisfaction:-- The user interface changes are unwelcome and have detracted from my ability to engage with the material.-- There have been arbitrary (and unannounced) changes to polices, e.g. dropping distinction grading.-- The price increase per course and locking down of assignments to only those who have paid has unfortunate side effects, including.-- In contrast to previous courses in this series which had an active community engagement the discussion forums are now relatively empty, running the courses more often is not going to help this situation.Having previously been an unpaid evangelist for the Coursera approach and materials I now find myself extremely reluctant to recommend this revised experience to colleagues."
956,WIX1002,"I found the material of this course to be very enlightening, it's not too difficult if you have the appropriate background. However, it will take a decent amount of time to fully complete. As part of the specialization, all of the skills I've learned were consolidated and put to an interesting use with this class."
957,WIX1002,"The lectures will not get you near the understanding you'll need to complete the assignments. though the resources will.The application is great, and hard so you'll actually have to understand the material.You have been warned, this course is very different to the other courses in the specialization!"
958,WIX1002,A very Imperative course!
959,WIX1002,Excellent course. His content is very interesting and realistic. I suggest this course if you want to improve your knolowgede about American culture and others countries.
960,WIX1003,tiada
961,WIX1002,It is very intriguing!
962,WIX1002,Wonderful course!Thank you so much for your efforts.
963,WIX1002,"Very interesting course. Each module had several ""surprises"" that fascinated me. All the speakers are easy to understand and interesting. Would like to see Part 2 with Russia, England, Turkey, etc. Makes you aware as to how differently countries can look at the same issue."
964,WIX1002,This course gave me an eye opening view of the world. I can see how this course can grow into a more dynamic and interactive education experience in the future.
965,WIX1002,"While some of the information presented was interesting, it seemed oddly biased towards the perspective of highly educated foreigners. I had hoped to get more information about how America is seen by the (foreign) masses."
966,WIX1002,seemed kind of dumb at first but got better
967,WIX1002,"A revealing look on how the rest of the world views the USA. Perhaps this should be offered to high school students, somt hey can better understand how other nationalities react to ""Americans"""
968,WIX1003,"Helpful on a knowing america through other country's eye. However, I think the course would be more interesting if if could include more discussion about how all those country and US view each other now instead of focusing much of its content on history."
969,WIX1003,No translations available despite what subtitles and transcripts say.
970,WIX1003,"Thank you very much for this beautiful course. So many concepts, clearly explained and with great passion. Best wishes from Montevideo, Uruguay."

975,WIX1003,The course is well detailed and well lectured.
976,WIX1003,"Useful course, separated into great topics and within a reasonable time-frame."
977,WIX1003,"An exceptional course. The breadth of material is wide, and yet there is a lot of detail and some quite specific instruction. The pace is good - each module covers just enough before moving on to the next topic, so it's engaging without being overwhelming. There's a good range of discussions, from economic theory, practical case studies and interviews with farmers. It builds on what I've learned elsewhere, so will be useful for real-world application."
978,WIX1003,Such an informative course
979,WIX1003,NIce course got a brief idea about agriculture by one of the renowned teacher David Pannell sir
980,WIX1003,"Interesting course on Agriculture and Economics, very useful to revise important economic concepts and also to learn more about agriculture. Highly recommended."
981,WIX1003,A good and relevant course
982,WIX1003,Very rewarding and insightfull learned a ton !
983,WIX1003,-
984,WIX1003,Provides a nice basis in understanding how economic principles are used to investigate agriculture production. Could provide a bit more of an economic foundation but the course is broad rather than deep.
985,WIX1003,It was an amazing experience. I learned so much. Thank you :)
986,WIX1003,"It's really about economics in its broader meaning: how different natural, social, and financial aspects play together to set present and future of farmers and the communities they live in.I highly recommend this course to anyone, even if not specifically interested in agriculture economics."
987,WIX1003,"I am much excited to partake in this course and it has really improved my worth. i strongly recommend it everyone. A very big THANK YOU to the coursera team for such an initiative and also to the Agriculture faculty of university of western of western Australia for such a partnership. i am very grateful, looking forward to work with you. BRAVO!!!"
988,WIX1003,"An excellent course and online experience. Coming from an industrial environmental management background, this has given me insight and interest"
989,WIX1003,Enriching content coupled with
990,WIX1003,Wonderful course!!I recommend it to everyone in the Agricultural space.
991,WIX1003,
992,WIX1003,"It's a beautiful course! Not only did I learn more (than I estimated) about economics and agriculture, there was also a nice balance between theory and practical applications. The recommended readings are relatable and reinforce the content of the videos. As a teacher, Dave is careful to present both sides of any issue (for example, he presents both gylphosate as the largest used herbicide, while maintaining that it is also very controversial). Pannell Discussions are a delight to read, since they deliver the intended content without sounding like research papers, which sometimes they may actually be based upon. It's wonderful to see such researchers having the patience to blog about such issues online! At a more subtle level, things like the location choices (farms for the agricultural weeks and buildings for institutional/policy weeks), altering background music - all made enriched my experience!Ofcourse, I think I will still have to brush up my concepts from time to time (since an online course can not replace internalization of a subject through rigorous comprehension and examination), and ofcourse I have quite a lot more to ""learn"" in this area (who doesn't? :P).But the course was a very informative, balanced and highly interesting introduction for me!"
993,WIX1003,A great short course delivered by one of the best agricultural economist in the world with a great publication history
994,WIX1003,The course was amazing i learned a lot of new things . if someone responding to these review i want to add something . In final quiz i did not find proper result . Which question i marked wrong and which one right . So please solve this problem.
995,WIX1003,Great Course have already learned so much. And still hoping to learn more.
996,WIX1003,"Great mental workout. Well-explained, but the coding challenges and bonus questions are challenging enough to allow for a lot of growth even for more advanced students."
997,WIX1003,As someone with only (UK) high school level maths I just about managed to follow this. I am still confused by logarithms. I guess I should go and read the maths for computer science resource.
998,WIX1003,I had a great time taking this course. It was a very good course in algorithms that explained the core concepts really well rather than just providing a high level overview. The assignments take some time but it aligns with what the instructor is teaching. The instructor is absolutely excellent because he takes the time to go through the math and iterations which helps to develop a deeper intuition for these algorithms. Looking forward to completing his other courses when I got time.
999,WIX1003,"Course is brilliant, but at least for me the completion took in average 3 times more effort than expected by authors (4-8 hrs/week). Of course this is mostly due to my low experience with programming, but still, might be relevant for other learners, who don!t have much experience."
1000,WIX1003,Sometimes too much mathematics.
1001,WIX1003,"It was an awesome and challenging course.And ,the lecturer Mr.Tim Roughgarden did introduced the gist that I need.So ,of course, I owe him a big thank.Thank you all."
1002,WIX1004,
1003,WIX1003,Professor Roughgarden explains everything clearly and is engaged in the topic. His excitement about algorithms comes though in his teaching.
1004,WIX1003,"Professor Roughgarden managed to explain all the algorithom ideas in a clear and simple way, and give us a very intuitive understanding of these methods. He did give me confidence in this field, even I am not majoring in CS."
1005,WIX1003,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I learned a great deal, and particularly enjoyed the programming assignments. Looking forward to starting course 2."
1006,WIX1003,Well designed and good to refresh the basics on many top algorithms
1007,WIX1003,N/A
1008,WIX1003,"This course has relatively few instructions about homework. I believe more test cases would be better.(Though able to be found in forum.) Besides, lecture is really awesome. Thanks a lot."
1009,WIX1003,Very good course in algorithms. I bought the book to help me understand but the lectures make it way easier and thus much more fun to understand the analysis. Looking forward to complete the spec
1010,WIX1003,I like this course a lot. Going to learn everything in the specialization.
1011,WIX1003,Excellent course. The statistical analysis was a little too fast and overwhelming towards the end but overall I learned a lot.
1012,WIX1003,I would really love to take this course as I m currently a computer science and thanks for granting me this course Yuhuuuuu!
1013,WIX1003,it is very important to learn algorithms as it is truly said it is heart of computer programming .. I am very happy and thanks for offering such a course to coursera and have just started hope will learn something so that it will help !!!!
1014,WIX1003,"The professor is very good. However, pictures and graphics mean a thousand words. These lectures rely too much on words. It makes it how to visualize the concepts. Hope to see more pictures. Animation will be the best."
1015,WIX1003,Great course but audio and video are terribly out of sync.
1016,WIX1003,"The course was pretty good. Definitely worth the money, and better than I expected from an online course. I thought it was a little heavy with probability proofs, but that's probably because I struggle with stats."
1017,WIX1003,No
1018,WIX1003,"I was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class, but I don't feel like I really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime. The class was challenging, but mostly for the wrong reasons. I spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning. It also took me much longer than the 4-8 hours per week advertised to complete each week."
1019,WIX1003,Thank you so much! I grown so much in the field of Algorithms because of this course. Onto the next one.
1020,WIX1003,Liked the style and intensity of the course!
1021,WIX1003,This is a best algorithm course I have ever done!
1022,WIX1003,"The instructor for this course is absolutely excellent. He is a master of the subject and explains the material to get at the concepts behind it rather than just a superficial understanding. He also does not get lost in mathematical notation, explaining clearly what each piece of the math he is showing us means."
1023,WIX1003,Very good course !
1024,WIX1003,It's an amazing introduction to algorithms. I enjoyed listening to the lectures. All the algorithms were explained in detail.
1025,WIX1003,The course was quite useful and enlightening！I was a good start to learn algorithms!
1026,WIX1003,"Tim Roughgarden teaches with wit and depth. Speaking with idiomatic verve, he injects life into Algorithms!"
1027,WIX1003,A must for wannable computer geek.
1028,WIX1003,The ideas from this course are fun.
1029,WIX1003,"Very good review of divide and conquer algorithms, however, I only recommend for those who are willing to put in the hard work as I found it challenging."
1030,WIX1003,I'm so glad that I've taken this course. This is really fantastic.
1031,WIX1004,-
1032,WIX1003,Banyak belajar
1033,WIX1003,"This is a great course. The teacher is very clear, and the material is very interesting. The programming assignments are interesting: the problems asked are very simple, but the input is generally too large to use brute force: you really have to implement the algorithms presented in the videos. This makes you realize how much smart algorithms can make a difference.The level of the class is relatively high, compared to other Coursera courses I've taken. If you want some serious training on algorithms, look no further."
1034,WIX1003,"I would recommend this course to anyone who has some experience with coding, but has not taken an algorithm course. I particularly like this course because it is more ""math-heavy"" than some of the other courses. After taking this course, you might not be able to solve all Leetcode problems (so probably will not help with your interviews directly), but from an intellectual point of view, I think the instructor does a good job explaining why people care about algorithms and how to analyze a class of algorithms rigorously."
1035,WIX1003,Challenging but Insightful. Definitely worth it.
1036,WIX1003,"This course offers one of the best introductions to reasoning about algorithms in a mathematical way. However, it is not just theory, it also gives you practical advise and forces you to polish up your programming skills as well by implementing some of the most useful and popular algorithms for sorting and similar applications in whatever language you wish."
1037,WIX1003,"Excellent course. What I valued most about this course was the clarity with which proofs and algorithms are explained. In learning algorithms one really profits from a great professor. Keep in mind that this course involves mathematics for proofs and I believe one has to be really curious about algorithms and dive into proofs to take full advantage of this course. Regarding assignments they are challenging but definitely approachable if you have some experience in programming. My advice: do not get discouraged, this is all about resilience!"
1038,WIX1003,Excellent course! I would recommend it to everyone who wants to learn algorithms.
1039,WIX1003,"Awesome,right now I know why algorithms are most important..!!"
1040,WIX1003,Tim gives great insights and draws attention to the right things at right time! Exercise and quizzes are very helpful and makes you think in right direction. Also the in-video-quizzes are well thought of to make you think about the topic being described in the video and thus makes it easy to understand the contents. This is just the right course anyone should take to improve/learn algorithm and data structures course. I've got got aaha! moments multiple times. Can't thank Tim enough!!
1041,WIX1003,Dr baik
1042,WIX1003,Cool class
1043,WIX1003,Exceptional materials and teacher.
1044,WIX1003,Great
1045,WIX1003,Challenging and fun!
1046,WIX1003,Amazing course!
1047,WIX1003,The unique value of taking the course: read and think through the material with guidance and completing its assignments is the efficiency by saving all the search cost would I collect on my own the good and succinct presentation of the knowledge and exercises with solutions (at least correctness checks.) The entire detail of an algorithm is hard to keep afresh in memory and one needs to refresh it from time to time. It is very cost-effective to take a course like this to accelerate the refresh.
1048,WIX1003,"Very good course on algorithms, a lot of terms explained in details with exercises"
1049,WIX1003,"Well structured, well explained. Great course!"
1050,WIX1003,Very nice course !!
1051,WIX1003,This is a great course for who doesn't have a computer science background!
1052,WIX1003,This course has some great quiz questions. I'd recommend it to people just for them.
1053,WIX1003,"The math in this course is quite difficult, but the professor does a great job of explaining it in a very easily understood way."
1054,WIX1003,very challenging fast-paced course
1055,WIX1003,I was very amazed with his really good lectures. Especially proving each algorithm's correctness and performance was very interesting and stimulated my curiosity. I also need to note that optional videos for probability helped me a lot to understand this course. I would like to recommend my friends definitely.
1056,WIX1003,"Great course to improve your skills on Algorithms, Space and Time complexities"
1057,WIX1003,Professor Roughgarden makes algorithms cool. With his passion for the topic you can't help but get excited about it too. I feel like I got a deep understanding of the topics covered versus just learning a recipe to sort an array. Looking forward to more.
1058,WIX1003,Needs hands-on experience with high-school probability to help crack the exams
1059,WIX1003,nothing
1060,WIX1003,It would be nice to see more examples especially were we have too many formulas. I still confused with probability.Also hadwritting isnt really helping. I am most of the time decoding scripts. In addition he is reading the formula at one moment and in around 3-4 seconds it appears on the screen. So I kind of listening him while trying to read what is happening on the screen. horrible experience.
1061,WIX1003,"Personally, I would recommend this course to anyone who really wants to learn how things work in that sort of algorithms. I found the assignments a little difficult, but also extremely helpful."
1062,WIX1003,tiada
1063,WIX1003,it was awsome!! one of the best courses and materials regarding algorithms i have taken!thanks a lot!totally worth my time and money =)
1064,WIX1003,Great course with interesting assignments.
1065,WIX1003,"the tutorials is not for average students, it takes a very high skill to understand them . also the quiz nd the assignments r too tough.hope you can make them a bit easy, the last one ,ie with graphs and trees was a bouncer. If the maths required is so high, please take a week to first explain the math fresher required in course and then start the main course"
1066,WIX1003,This is great course
1067,WIX1003,It's an amazing courses aiming to high-level and fast-pace algorithmic thinker.
1068,WIX1003,"I enjoyed this course, it was more challenging than the first one in the sequence, especially in the graph-search portion. The last 2 weeks are much more simple, but it is still essential for any serious student of CS to learn about data structures, especially common and practical DS such as heaps and hash tables."
1069,WIX1003,"The professor is amazing. He has the ability to present the material very clearly, concise, and with a good dose of humour! I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in algorithms and data structures as an undergraduate or a professional."
1070,WIX1003,good in depth knowedge.
1071,WIX1003,"This was another good one, providing a slightly deeper dive than I had seen in other courses. The big revelation here, for me, was the addition of Bellman-Ford algorithm for evaluating shortest path in networks (graphs) that have some negative distance values between nodes.I also like the approach to data structures (high-level, then drilling down into increasing detail for level of interest) I find it hard to say I understand a data structure based on ""Interface and Theory"" and I would have felt the certification meant more with at least a rudimentary implementation. I guess that makes me a coder at at heart.I am about to jump into the next course of the specialization: Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming As with the two courses before, I am expecting new revelations about the kind of programming issues I've been solving for more than fifteen years."
1072,WIX1003,A really good course
1073,WIX1003,Useful refresher!
1074,WIX1003,"I learned a lot lot lot, no more to say. Fantastic."
1075,WIX1003,"very good course! but I think this specialization focus on mathematical analysis, we need to practice more"
1076,WIX1003,"Great course, at least for people like me who lack of computer science background."
1077,WIX1003,This course let me feel algorithms is not hard as I thought. It is worth to learn
1078,WIX1003,"I really enjoyed it. Perfect balance of practice and theory together with clear explanations. I also appreciate the mentors efforts that always answer any questions and try to help. Thank you Tim, Vassilis, and Arjit."
1079,WIX1003,"This is a great course. The teacher is very clear, and the material is very interesting. The programming assignments are interesting: the problems asked are very simple, but the input is generally too large to use brute force: you really have to implement the algorithms presented in the videos. This makes you realize how much smart algorithms can make a difference.The level of the class is relatively high, compared to other Coursera courses I've taken.

1080,WIX1004,-
1081,WIX1003,Good learning
1082,WIX2001,"Nice course and exams problems. I recommend this course if you want to understand the basics of graphs, trees and heaps."
1083,WIX2001,The material was a little light and far fewer video quiz questions to test our understanding of the material. I also tried to test myself on BFS and DFS by doing online quizzes like geeksforgeeks - bombed really hard.
1084,WIX2001,"Excellent mix of math (not too much), programming details (probably needs a little bit more) and practical applications!"
1085,WIX2001,This is great course and amazing refresher!!!
1086,WIX2001,The early part of the course does not make a compelling argument for why we need to analyse complexity. The lectures are interesting but not helpful for use in business.
1087,WIX2001,"Super interesting course, I have never seen in my lifetime.Watch me ;))"
1088,WIX2001,I am really satisfied by the course .....just love the lecture and slides too :) .....
1089,WIX2001,"Tim does an excellent job explaining things at depth and at the same time keeping things interesting. The quizes and programming assignments are well thought and carefully balanced vs the material taught. They force you to stretch just a bit beyond the lectures, which is a good thing IMHO.And there is a wealth of advanced/optional material for the curious."
1090,WIX2001,I love how clear the videos (and notes) are and re-watching them really helped a lot! I wish there was more discussion on the forms though!
1091,WIX2001,It's challenging but interesting.
1092,WIX2001,"The best Coursera class I took so far! The instructor has a good pedagogic approach -- for every problem he discusses, he starts with an intuitive explanation illustrated on a simple example, and afterwards provides a rather rigorous justification for the algorithms (omitting only secondary details).I found the problems challenging, and the quizzes required quite some thought, not only repeating/slightly modifying statements made already in the lectures. This made it feel closer to a real class than the other Coursera courses I took so far."
1093,WIX2001,"Very much to the point, no nonsense, good course!"
1094,WIX2001,Many of the weeks' videos were out of order.
1095,WIX2001,"Week 4 was significantly more time-consuming than the others, but it is still an excellent course overall. Recommended!"
1096,WIX2001,Well done!!!! That is the first English course I have finished!!!!
1097,WIX2002,"Well done, made a very difficult topic accessible."
1098,WIX2002,if u do those math it will definitely help u to be advance
1099,WIX2002,It's a very nice course if you're doing some refreshing of college chemistry.
1100,WIX2002,"The material was good, but I did notice a couple of lectures and in-course questions presented out of order. What really turned me off, however were quizzes. In weekly quizzes the first answer was always the right answer. In the final quiz most of the questions had the first answer as the right answer. Since randomizing the answers is so obvious and easy, I am really at a loss why the quizzes would be presented in this way."
1101,WIX2002,A lot of calculation errors and incorrect answers
1102,WIX2002,no
1103,WIX2002,"Excellent course, very challenging, instructors take the time to explain the work very well.My only suggestion would be that week four be split into two more manageable sections, as it was quite large and there were many different topics covered. As aqueous equilibria are not my strong suit, it was a lot to take in"
1104,WIX2002,Tutorial tertalu banyak assignment
1105,WIX2002,Great Course
1106,WIX2002,"The course is well-structured, clear and coherent. The assessments are quite good too. Recommend it!"
1107,WIX2002,"Excellent course. If you are struggling with high school chem, or need a good foundation for college chem - this course moves you through the concepts and gives you lots of practice problems."
1108,WIX2002,"It is a good course for beginners, but it is too slow for advanced learners who want to refresh their knowledge."
1109,WIX2002,N/A
1110,WIX2002,I am new to teaching AP Chem and this class was a great refresher for me....I suggested that my students enroll.
1111,WIX2002,"Although I had taken this course and higher levels in the past, there are still many subjects that I do not feel I have mastered them. This course helps me to achieve that goal. Also, it does not mean that this is not a flawless program, but by far is much much much better than the program I had attended in the past.I like to appreciate both instructors for their time and the effort they have put into making these wonderful videos for many students around the world!"
1112,WIX2002,This whole program is so knowledge-giving...thanks to Coursera and University of Kentucky.😊
1113,WIX2002,"There were some mistakes and weird glitches, but overall solid overview of second-half chem"
1114,WIX2002,Great.. I'm chemistry.. And this course is very useful to remember all things have you learnt in the university... Thank u
1115,WIX2002,This is realy helpfull and interesting.
1116,WIX2002,Itt's great! Nicely explained with step by step resolution of problems. I loked it :D
1117,WIX2002,Great explanation. I am very satisfied.
1118,WIX3002,thank you for the course. great
1119,WIX3002,i like it but there is ALOT to do i am 13 taking this for science class and i am starting to get lost in what the are saying
1120,WIX3002,"Needs some means of feedback. Several times I felt sure that a question was wrong, but there's nothing to be done about it. Additionally, it would be nice if, after completing (and passing) a test, you could see what you did wrong and how the answer should have been determined."
1121,WIX3002,very easy to follow
1122,WIX3002,The course is very well organised and presented.
1123,WIX3002,Very Good course ! Hope to see Organic Chemistry and some Biology courses by University of Kentucky like this.
1124,WIX3002,It's great! Thank you for everything :))
1125,WIX3002,"amazing course. all topics about chemistry are here, very good quizes. a good course"
1126,WIX3003,"I used this course as a significant portion of my preparation for the CLEP Chemistry exam, and passed today with an A! Thank you!"
1127,WIX3004,
1128,WIX3005,kind of boring and I am not learning how half this info is obtained or why it is relevant to real world chemistry
1129,WIX3005,Too many assignment
1130,WIX3005,The subjects are very well covered. Great explanation. Very recommendable
1131,WIX3005,Excellent lecture videos with practice problems that are very helpful in recalling the chemical concepts. Really wish this course could offer at least an SOA so learners can be more motivated.
1132,WIX3005,Thoroughly enjoyed this course! Problems and assignments are quite challenging but doable
1133,WIX3005,Dissapointed with the class
1134,WIX3005,This challenging course improves understanding of algorithms and is intellectually stimulating. I learnt the theory behind algorithms and how they are applied to solve real world problems.
1135,WIX3005,"Awesome! The professor is obviously very knowledgeable about the ancient Greece history and it's a pity that I'm done with the course; I wish I could attend the full, comprehensive version of it! On top of the basic history, I appreciated the comments on the research method, the nuances in the interpretation of different events, the presentation of additional elements (e.g., pictures, maps, artifacts) to support the lectures, etc. I was sometimes rushing a bit to go through all the reading assignments but I'm glad to know now what to read and where to search to get more information on the topic. I think it's one of the good side-effect of this course: it motivates you to learn even more about the ancient Greeks. Thanks!"
1136,WIX3005,"Very good. The readings indicated helped to expand my knowledge of Ancient Greece. Every undergraduate student in History, Philosophy, Archeology etc, must take this course."
1137,WIX3005,Dr is great and helpful
1138,WIX3005,"Excellent overview and introduction to Greek history. I am travelling to Greece later this year and wanted to get a better understanding of Greek history to appreciate the art, literature, architecture and sites which I will be visiting. This course was both educational and entertaining. I highly recommend and look forward to building upon the knowledge acquired in the course. Thank you!"
1139,WIX3005,"The course was fascinating. At first, I must admit Professor Andy seemed quite dry at first, but as I began to understand his wit, I waited continually for him to deliver something extremely hilarious. I still laugh when I think about the reference to ""Bats whispering"". His understanding of the topic was excellent and his ability to communicate such a tremendous span of critical Western history efficiently and in an organized manner made the course valuable to me. I learned enough to of course understand I knew little, though I have written down several areas I want to research on my own to expand my knowledge. Great course, great lectures, thank you for presenting it to us and helping us learn!"
1140,WIX3005,"Ancient History: it is not boring anymore (for me)! Charming Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak gives materials in a way, that you feel an every character (even mithological) was a real person involved in a real story. I also like nice sence of humor and a voice of lecturer! A lot of reading was easy and interesting to learn during the course."
1141,WIX3005,A fantastic course: Very well-presented and hugely informative.
1142,WIX3005,Great course !
1143,WIX3005,Comprehensive course. I gained a great deal of information that helped to fill gaps in my own knowledge base.
1144,WIX3005,Great Job. Andy definitely is the best.
1145,WIX3005,Excellent course. Really inspired me to learn more.
1146,WIX3005,What a great course! I have enjoyed it a lot!
1147,WIX3005,Very Interesting course that covers a huge range of topics over a long period of time. A very well informed lecturer who can speak about the subject matter in a clear and concise manner.
1148,WIX3005,"Fantastic Course! Really well structured, lectures are really interesting and I have really enjoyed it!!"
1149,WIX3005,Well prepared course.
1150,WIX3005,Some great material and I learned a lot. I did in fact complete the course but chose not to submit written material. Sometimes the lecturer was perhaps a little dry.
1151,WIX3005,none
1152,WOA7001,Excellent course. It has a perfect rhythm and the teacher has a good pronunciation which it is a important detail for no native english like me. I recommend strongly.
1153,WOA7001,"Fantastic course. Information packed, but not overwhelming. The links to online readings provide nice context for a lot of the lectures, but weren't in any way daunting. Highly recommend!"
1154,WOA7001,"Even though the professor talks in a monotone voice, I was so fascinated by the course content that I was able to overlook it."
1155,WOA7001,"I found this a really interesting course to complete. The lectures are easily digestible and help to provide context for various readings that you complete along the way. I would have liked an introductory lecture that gave an overview of some of the major themes of the course more clearly (I felt a bit at sea throughout the first topic having never studied this before. I didn't know what to pay attention to). But once we were underway, I had no trouble working out the flow of events. I really enjoyed this- thank you!"
1156,WOA7001,"I love listening to these lectures. The professor is highly informed on the subject matter and his personality brings these myths and historical insights to life through engaging, clear story telling. I honestly did not know what to expect from the course, but I am deeply interested and hope to retain at least the main points of the lectures to take with me in my understanding of the world and the development of our richly influenced society by the Ancient Greeks."
1157,WOA7001,tiada
1158,WOA7001,"A good starting point to learn more about the ""Ancient Greeks"""
1159,WOA7001,"Great course, but the quizzes are not quite there yet. They focus too much on minor details and the questions are sometimes awkwardly phrased."
1160,WOA7001,"I found Wesleyan University's course ""The Ancient Greeks"" rich in varied information. Professor Andrew Szegedy-Maszak's lectures are particularly thoughtful and the quizzes are clear. An altogether enjoyable, well-worth experience."
1161,WOA7001,Very informative and filled with interesting tidbits. I loved it.
1162,WOA7001,"Totally excellent and enthralling! The subject matter is well treated and easy to follow. The quality of the videos are top as well. I fell the the mix of lecture, reading and quiz at the end of the week was just right."
1163,WOA7015,"excellent course, I enjoyed it a lot!It helped me to gain an overview over ancient greek history.Great lecturer!"
1164,WOA7015,"Fantastic course. Very enjoyable, quite clear and shed light on quite a lot of complex concepts. It's not hard to follow, but certainly arouses your curiosity and makes you explore more. Thank you for all these great lectures."
1165,WOA7015,"An excellent course, one of the best I’ve done at Coursera. I hope Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak will give more courses on this subject, starting with the end of this course, the 4th century BCE, progressing to the 3rd, 2nd etcetera BCE!"
1166,WOA7015,Cool
1167,WOA7015,Perfect!
1168,WOA7015,The professor was extremely knowledgeable and clear.
1169,WOA7015,Wonderful course !
1170,WOA7015,I love the way this professor talk about events. I learned so much.
1171,WOA7015,"I love this class. So much important history that can be related to current events and people. I highly recommend everyone to take this course and think about it. We still make the mistakes these people did, and the successes are a part of our existence today. Instructor is very pleasant too."
1172,WOA7015,
1173,WOA7015,Inspiring instructor. A lot of clarity in the lectures and some really interesting facts and stories. This course is almost like watching a great movie.
1174,WOA7015,"Thank you so much for conducting such a well paced course to the prelude of Greek's history!The course was simply fascinating! Professor Andrew's teaching style was very detailed, often humorous and also engaging. It felt as if I was really present in one of his lectures in the university classroom!The provided reading assignments also immensely helped in gaining an in-depth understanding of the course content!The active discussion forum gave me the opportunity to fine tune my learning through Q/As and additional articles for further reading, provided by the very generous, friendly and encouraging mentors!Looking forward to such a course in future,With best regards,Saoumitaa G"
1175,WOA7015,"I have learned many issues and insights, and I am most satisfied."
1176,WOA7015,"The professor certainly knows a lot about this subject, but his delivery is stiff and dry. If he shared his passion for the subject with us it would be more enjoyable. On the plus side, I admire how he shares the Greek language with us so capably and combines art with his lectures."
1177,WOA7015,course yang menarik
1178,WOA7015,I will keep thinking with the Greeks.
1179,WOA7015,Best instructor and lectures covering the entire area..But Assignments should include more questions so that to cover entire content of course.
1180,WOA7015,"So thanks Prof ,i think that it was a great course and really my hope now is to visit Greece to recall Homer,Socrates,Hesiod,Solon.........................As a course ,Ancient Greeks resource me much and i advice all students to take this wonderful course."
1181,WOA7015,"It's really well organized. I like the pace of the course and the voice of ""Professor Andy""!"
1182,WOA7015,This is my first coursera course and I love it.
1183,WOA7015,A global and balance view of the ancient greek history
1184,WOA7015,Dr patut fokus dalam kelas tutorial untuk membantu pelajar dalam assignment 
1185,WOA7015,"Awesome course, excelent material, great classes."
1186,WOA7015,Excellent course!It is a must take course for the lover of Ancient Greece.
1187,WOA7015,"The course is very well structured for a diverse range of learners. You could get a very deep knowledge and understanding through the readings (Greek tragedies, Herodotus, Thucydides etc) and the lectures, or a broad survey of the Ancient Greeks by just watching the videos. The professor also combines the narrative, the methods used to study those narratives and the limits to our knowledge in an erudite yet engaging manner.Definitely recommended as a top quality resource for anyone who wants to learn about Ancient Greece."
1188,WOA7015,"An excellent course for those interested in an introduction to classical studies. I studied roman history and latin at high school, and I was eager to learn more about the ancient greeks. This course provided me a great introduction. And it raised my interest in reading ancient greek authors. That was the strongest point for me: no need of animation, I liked the invitation to read ancient texts."
1189,WOA7015,This is an excellent course and I have enjoyed listening and reading everything it has to offer.
1190,WOA7015,Great Course!
1191,WOA7015,WWonderful course.great professor
1192,WOA7015,Interesting and informative! Professor is the best!
1193,WOA7015,This was an excellent course on The Ancient Greeks. I studied Ancient History and Archaeology at University a few years ago and I found this a brilliant refresher to knowledge I had forgotten. It was well structured and interestingly taught.
1194,WOA7015,Very interesting! I wish there is some animation film to explain the narative.
1195,WOA7015,Wonderful and interesting course. Thanks!
1196,WOA7015,"it´s very interesting course ,it gives you all the details you need in the classic studies ."
1197,WOA7015,An amazing course! I have found many interesting details and also received completely new way of seeing the history of democracy! Special acknowledgment to professor Andrew Szegedy-Maszak for his work and generous way to give knowledge to the students!
1198,WOA7015,It's just plain excellent. Great content and professor.
1199,WOA7015,A very interesting course and I'm at the beginning of this course and already have learned a lot about
1200,WOA7015,"Outstanding course, delivered measuredly, concisely, and clearly. A wonderful panoramic introduction to the Ancient Greeks. Inspires one to dig deeper. Thank you so much for offering this course on Coursera."
1201,WOA7015,This course was simply fantastic ! I was captivated. Pr. Szegedy-Maszak is such a great teacher. He makes you really live and love the subject. I'm looking forward for new courses. Thank you very much.
1202,WOA7015,the tests are difficult.
1203,WOA7015,"An engaging look at Ancient Greece from the Minoan civilisation on Crete through to the death of Socrates (with some bonus material on Alexander the Great by popular demand!). The course is extremely well-designed and presented by first-rate lecturer, Professor Andrew Szegedy-Maszak of Wesleyan University. Totally recommended."
1204,WOA7015,N/A
1205,WOA7015,Excellent course! I'd like to thank the professor for such good lectures
1206,WOA7015,well presented and thought provoking
1207,WOA7015,"Fantastic course. Nicely paced with good lectures and background reading. Highly recommended if you want to learn about history of ancient Greece, with a side order of drama, literature, lives of women, slaves and metics (do the course and you will know who they are). Highly recommended."
1208,WOA7015,"I enjoyed this course. It was very interesting, the teacher explained each topic well. A very informative journey through the Ancient Greece."
1209,WOA7015,Great course that let you have a quick look over the greek rise and fall over 2000 years ago.
1210,WOA7015,"Poor visual aids, course content and format."
1211,WOA7015,"It is a good course and the instructor is very knowledgeable on the subject. It´s just that, after a while studying about wars it seems that there´s no ending or purpose. It is a very good analisys though."
1212,WOA7015,"Loving this course! Very engaging subject matter and instructor has discussed topics in such a way as to make you want to know more and to continue with the lessons even though it's way past bedtime!I have learned quite a bit so far and am developing further interest in that time period, especially how the Ancient Greeks have shaped societal constructs and belief systems and how they have affected us throughout the ages to modern life as we know it."
1213,WOA7015,"The professor is very comfortable lecturing in front of a camera, which makes it quite easy to follow the lectures and what he is explaining."
1214,WOA7015,Professor is very knowledgable and honest about the topic. As a student of classical civilizations I loved his simple communication style to explain concepts that tend to become overly complicated by bad professors. Definitely enjoyed
1215,WOA7015,"The course was very interesting. My recommendation would be to also include videos as resources, where possible. For example, I found videos of 'Medea' and 'Antigone' on Youtube and watched them and loved them! Since it's theater, it's completely different seeing the play than just reading it."
1216,WOA7015,It's a nice way to learn how were the greeks! In a fews words: Awseome!
1217,WOA7015,I've found this course extremely helpful as I teach Greek history to my high school classes. Professor Andy explains crucial events in enough detail yet the videos are concise enough to watch multiple in one evening with good comprehension. Thank you so much for the lectures and great resources! They are invaluable to my planning my unit on Ancient Greece!
1218,WOA7015,This is wonderful swathe through Greek history. I'm glad I was invited along.Thank you.
1219,WOA7015,Great course! Excelente professor
1220,WOA7015,no
1221,WOA7015,"Excellent survey course. Only wish there was more information given on details of daily life, also wish the course was a bit longer. Had issues with verifying the quizes."
1222,WOA7015,"Professor Andy lectures really made me enjoy my time spent learned and studying about the Ancient Greeks, now having skimmed the top of some history of the Ancient Greeks I look to discover more by myself and as suggested in this course. ""Think like the Greeks."" Good day."
1223,WOA7015,"I found The Ancient Greeks course to be excellent, highly informative and well presented. I found the lectures, use of maps and pictures of ancient artifacts to be most useful in supporting the topic. Highly recommended."
1224,WOA7015,Absolutely superb course by lecturer who knows the material inside out.
1225,WOA7015,"The lecturer was quite knowledgeable, but I think he needs to work on his presentation a bit. Particularly at the start of the course he didn't quite know what he was trying to say"
1226,WOA7015,"I had forgotten how much reading there is! I didn't have a lot of time, but I enjoyed the lectures a lot and it revisited my interest in history and ancient civilizations. I think I learned more from this than the Ancient Civ class I took many years ago in college! Most enjoyable!"
1227,WOA7018,"Very good course. I'm enjoying this immensely. Maybe a little less recommended reading, some of the readings are repetitions."
1228,WOA7018,Informative and enjoyable
1229,WOA7019,
1230,WOA7018,Well presented and very enjoyable.
1231,WOC7004,"Well presented, wonderful insight into the world of the ancient Greeks. I learnt a lot, and it has whetted my appetite for more. I really loved this course, and enjoyed it very much indeed"
1232,WOC7004,"Elaborate and absorbing lectures, it was a great pleasure to follow. Thank you, PhDAndrew Szegedy-Maszak! All the best, MK"
1233,WOC7004,Gave me a great overview of the ancient greeks. I now would like to visit these ancient places.
1234,WOC7004,A lesson with discussion about the question of quizz.
1235,WOC7004,I love history and so this class is perfect for historians alike.
1236,WOC7004,An extremely intresting and informative course!
1237,WOC7004,It is a great educational experience that opened the door to the ancient Greek history.
1238,WOC7004,"I knew nothing about ancient Greece before. Excellent course. Thanks. David Pearsall, Greenville NC"
1239,WOC7004,"This is exactly the model that other humanities and ""soft science"" courses should follow on Coursera. Your grades and progress are solely based on your own performance and not on the whims of student reviewers. One is also spared the experience of grading the work of others which is often nearly as painful of a punishment as undergoing a root canal sans anesthesia. Other instructors and the leadership of Coursera need to pay attention to how this course is set up in order to make their own future endeavors better for their students."
1240,WOC7004,Very interesting and well explained.
1241,WOC7004,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The lectures were easy to follow and the additional reading material fit to the lectures. I would subscribe to a follow-up course any time!
1242,WOC7004,"wonderful really interesting course, well presented and full of fascinating information; well worth doing"
1243,WOC7004,Limited in scope but very good for the time/topics it covers.
1244,WOC7004,"A Great course. very Informative I recommend it to all who want to learn a lot about the ancient Greeks their culture,history and contributions to today's society."
1245,WOC7004,The reading assignments were really good and the pace of the course was very effective.
1246,WOC7004,Very very good course!
1247,WOC7011,"I loved this course and I was a bit sad when I finished it. I found it very interesting and the teacher was very good explaining and making it simple enough. The material used (presentations, maps, photos) really helped to round up the lessons. Overall, a ver"
1248,WOC7011,Perfect course
1249,WOC7011,A really great course!!
1250,WOC7015,"Even though it covers some topics a little ""superficially"", this course is of great value for those who want to get more knowledge about the history and development of ancient Greece. It is really interesting that it does not only cover political and military issues, but also daily life and civic aspects of this civilization.Really recommendable!"
1251,WOC7015,"Excellent overview of Ancient Greek history. Very much enjoyed the lectures with clear explanations of different aspects of Greek political, military and social structure and the differences between the different polis. Reading material was enjoyable as well -- appreciated the opportunity to read, or reread in many cases, Herodotus, Thucydides and Plutarch. The mixtures of readings also gave the opportunity to view different persons and events from different perspectives which was refreshing. I highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in Ancient Greece or the beginnings of facets of Western culture."
1252,WOC7015,Professor Andy can tell a story and is the best damn Professor at wesleyan!
1253,WOC7015,"The profesor is excepcional, and have a very good english, Thank you"
1254,WOC7015,"Very interesting class. The readings were helpful in understanding a deep appreciation for the subjects covered. Still dislike the multiple guess questions at the end of each section, think essays would show mastery of the bigger picture, but understand the constrains of time on the professor. Still, I would recommend this class as a basic introduction to Ancie"
1255,WOC7015,"What an excellent course! The lecturer sets a good pace and is very engaging. The subject matter is interesting, and the course hours per week are very reasonable. I also really like the MCQs to consolidate your learning at the end of each lecture."
1256,WOC7015,A very interesting and useful introduction to the Ancient Greeks era.
1257,WOC7015,Good introduction to the period - balances political history with wider social and cultural topics. Well supported by original source material. Maybe the expectations of weekly reading are set a little high for many students. I personally found the sections on early Greece particularly interesting as I was least familiar with that era.
1258,WOC7015,"Excellent course! Very knowledgeable professor, yet easy and pleasant to follow. The programme is well structured and the content approached with some depth (considering the introductory nature of the course). I would have loved to see, though, a focus more on philosophy (pre- and post- socratic), visual arts and the Hellenistic period, as it is most of the times neglected, even in today's historical accounts. Hope to see more courses on Classical Studies soon at Coursera."
1259,WOC7020,The course is ok. But we need really less lectures and more application based courses.
1260,WOC7020,Brilliant course. Superbly assembled and presented material. And I love the prof's wry sense of humour!I've been wanting to learn about this subject for many years. Highly recommended.
1261,WOC7020,"Ancient Greeks is brief overview of Greek civilization from about 1800 to 320 BC, starting with the Minoans of Crete and ending with the death of Alexander the Great. Prof. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak demonstrates great knowledge about the subjects, covering literature, government, and philosophy.Yet the course has two setbacks: 1) The professor stutters through the lectures, displaying his obvious discomfort being on camera; and 2) the overview is very expansive, so there isn't great study in any single theater of Greek civilization.There is, however, solid coverage. I also felt the chapter on the 4th cent. BC, done to address complaints about no coverage of Alexander and Macedon, feels tacked on. It's a long, but somehow hurried lecture.That said, I liked this course. I gained greater knowledge of important political and literary figures, such as Solon and Alcibiades, than I did when I studied the subject back in college."
1262,WOC7020,"Excellent course. Professor's Andy's calm and careful delivery is precise, scholarly and entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the readings, which I urge other students not to skip."
1263,WOC7020,A wonderful guided tour of ancient greece from the bronze age through Alexander. Thank you!
1264,WOC7020,"Material is excellent, but new format for coursera pages is horrible. Hard to find anything, taking pdf dumps to create saved artifacts from class is completely broken, quizzes do not allow you to see your answers after you submit them even after you have finished the class so you have to remember to save the quiz answers before submission. Worst part for me is that you can only get a certificate if you agree to verified certificates which means giving coursera access to your webcam and also allowing them to save your typing patterns with to me I don't mind paying something for the courses, but will not use verified certificates as I have no need for their verification, and will only take on demand classes that use this format if they have content i really want."
1265,WOC7020,very useful for newcomer
1266,WOC7020,"This is such a wonderful class, though it's kind of hard... But I like it very much!"
1267,WOC7020,"It was a great course, I really enjoyed it.Thank you very much."
1268,WOC7020,COMPLETAMENTE RECOMENDADO PARA CONOCER LA INGENIERÍA QUE SE APLICA EN LOS SISTEMAS DE TRANSPORTE
1269,WOC7020,very good i leran to much
1270,WOC7020,great course in transportion
1271,WOC7020,"Great course, loved it! Maybe a bit easier than the previous ones in this specialization, or maybe it's just because I started using python(compared to java and c in previous courses). Anyways the course was fun. :)"
1272,WOX7001,Far too easy
1273,WOX7001,Great content! And explained very well. I was asked a question on graphs in my amazon interview. Wish I had taken the course earlier. Thanks!
1274,WOX7001,Nice and clear!
1275,WOX7001,It was one of the best course. The problems in the programming weekly assignments were very carefully designed. All the mentors were really amazing and having in-depth knowledge in algorithms. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and I feel I am much more comfortable tacking graph problems and solving them efficiently. Thank you!
1276,WOX7001,"Overall good course, programming tasks are fun!However, some of the video lectures are only of average quality. Accent of the TA is sometimes confusing (fyi I'm not a native speaker)."
1277,WOX7001,Very good course. Learn a lot.
1278,WOX7001,"Great course, thank you!"
1279,WOX7001,Fairly good course. I wish the edge cases for some of the programming assignments had some more discussions. Needed some sifting through the forums while stuck.
1280,WOX7001,"This was a really excellent little unit. I really appreciate going over all the algorithms in this course and I have a better understanding of how we explore graphs to find valuable information. I really enjoyed the challenge optional week as well. I felt less stress to complete it since it was optional, but it was still very challenging and I couldn't complete it (even though I really tried). I feel the challenge optional week may need to be made slightly easier though to give people who are normally busy to get a chance to try and solve the problems in it (it did eat up a lot of my spare time). Excellent work, great course (wish I knew contraction hierarchies better, been reading some papers but still unsure of how to best implement it)."
1281,WOX7001,"Great course, great lectures!"
1282,WOX7001,"Lectures were very clear and assignments were really helpful for me to understand gist of each algorithms. This course, however, only covers 1. Basic concepts of Graph, 2. Shortest Path, and 3. Minimum Spanning Tree which doesn’t seem to be rich.With more diverse and interesting problems associated with Graph included, I strongly believe that students will get much from this course.Thank you"
1283,WOX7001,Was very informative course. Learned a lot stuff.
1284,WOX7001,Good sessions and assignments.
1285,WOX7001,Very interesting and well presented course. I particularly wanted to learn more on graphs and this helped me get not only a basic but a more advanced understanding.
1286,WOX7001,Incredible collection of graph algorithms. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
1287,WOX7001,very nice course. The content covered is very useful.
1288,WOX7001,"I loved it, great work from the instructors!while ( true ){thank you very much ;}"
1289,WOX7001,"Outstanding. I highly recommend paying for this course instead of auditing it, so you have access to the graded homework assignments. The problems are ingenious, and so much fun I wish I could do them again. Without doing the assignments, I wouldn't have learned as much as I did. It's well worth the money."
1290,WOX7001,Amazing content. Loved it!
1291,WOX7001,great course
1292,WOX7001,Great
1293,WOX7001,Another great course. Thanks a lot!!
1294,WOX7001,Very good explanations
1295,WOX7001,"The course was awesome but the ""Algorithms on Graphs"" course the month after has some ridiculous extras. Since the course hereafter will have additions related to how Graphs are used in the real world today - I have to give this current course 4 stars. I can't comment on the next course but I think talking about how graphs are used in RL is immeasurable. Good Luck. I do hope you give this course a chance if you're interested in Graphs or looking for a refresher like I was."
1296,WOX7001,"Good course , nice assignments , a little bit more of explanation might be helpful for beginners"
1297,WOX7001,"Fantastic course! I am new on graph algorithms and this course totally mesmerized me. The course material is just right for me , neither too difficult nor too easy. And the programming task is challenging and I like the way the test cases not shown to us because it pushed me to think of strange or rare case on which my program may fail. I really learned a lot from this course! Thanks to the instructors!"
1298,WOX7001,Instructors in Algorithms on Graphs manage to provide a placid -yet complete- course.
1299,WOX7001,Great course! it would be better if the course provide more problems that is not directly the implementation of what is taught
1300,WOX7001,"Great course, would have been better, if authors added more assignments and material to study as graphs have so many applications. Anyways, I do believe that motivated learners will go ahead and find more challenges for themselves. As always, thanks to all the instructors, keep up the good work!"
1301,WOX7001,Great Course
1302,WOX7001,Interesting course to start learning about graphs
1303,WOX7001,"Awesome explanation, very concise."
1304,WOX7001,It helped me to understand graphs from a programming point of view. I got fun when solving the problems.
1305,WOX7001,I really enjoyed the course.
1306,WOX7001,Great Course. Compact and clear. Learnt a great deal from it. Thanks!
1307,WOX7001,"Fun course, well done. Overall I felt the class materials were very handled in this course. Further, it was tightly focused on a related set of algorithms where knowledge of each built on preceding knowledge well. Everything I need from a distance/on-line course and presented well."
1308,WOX7001,"For me this was a refresher. And it was an excellent way to explain and work on graphing algorithms. The step-by-step explanations of the algorithms here are great for truly understanding what's going on under the hood, so to speak."
1309,WOX7001,Very informative and useful content just like the other courses in this series.
1310,WOX7001,Good Questions and very good Test Cases.
1311,WOX7001,All basic graph algorithms are covered.
1312,WOX7001,"This is an interesting course, which is closely related to the graph theory in mathematics. As the previous courses, programming assignments are given every week but it is slightly harder than before. Some pseudo codes are not that easy to convert into the programming language. Yet, it is one of the excellent courses in Coursera."
1313,WOX7001,"The course contents and assignments are clear and well-structured. Compared to the algorithms & data structures courses, this one was a lot easier (for me anyway). I would have liked additional content on, for instance, (Markovian) grids/fields, but perhaps this will be covered in the 'advanced algorithms' course."
1314,WOX7001,"useful and fundamental, interesting assignment"
1315,WOX7001,The teaching quality is very average and mediocre at best.The assignments are merely implementation of lectures .The Stanford and Princeton courses on Algorithms are better courses to take for one to pursue a serious study of Algorithms.
1316,WOX7001,Excellent! I learn some new algorithms on graphs.
1317,WOX7001,worth looking at the course
1318,WOX7001,"Another great course! I started this one right after completing data structures and found it particularly interesting as graph problems seem to pop up everywhere in our modern, networked world.Compared to the data structures course this definitely felt easier, however this may be down to me being more comfortable with my chosen language as well as with the overall process and structure of the assignments. Nevertheless there are some fun problems here that have connections to problems in the ""real"" world.As a side note, I recommend doing the data structures course before this one, as some of the algorithms discussed rely on data structures, so understanding them and better yet having them implemented already will help a lot with focusing on the new material and passing the assignments.Thanks again all the teachers for the great course!"
1319,WOX7001,The way the prof. teaches is really amazing . I got all whatever he said and i really enjoyed the course.Thanks to Coursera team for putting up this course for begginers like me and special thanks to the Professor .
1320,WOX7001,very bad course
1321,WOX7001,"This course is easier than the previous three, but will help in gaining basic to intermediate knowledge on graphs."
1322,WOX7001,"Really Good Course , Problems are of good quality , the content is time saving and easy to understand."
1323,WOX7001,This review is based on the last three courses that I have undertaken in the Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization.While running our tests the output does provide the time and memory used for running our algorithms. I think it would also be instructive to see the running time of the best implementation in the particular language and the best time achieved ever by a student in such a course. It would provide us with an additional motivation to think about better and efficient implementations.Note: I do understand that running times might not always be an exact reflection of the actual time the algorithm takes.
1324,WOX7001,Very good explanations. The course assignments were well thought-out and were the right difficulty.
1325,WOX7001,Great Course to understand the graph algorithms and hone the skills to solve the Graph Problems.
1326,WOX7001,"I must say I feel disappointed especially when the whole Data Structures and Algorithms series take this course as the selling point ( ""you'll learn how to compute the fastest route between New York and Mountain View thousands of times faster than classic algorithms and close to those used in Google Maps"", blablabla), but it turns out to be the least challenging course with only elementary introduction to the big topic. Perhaps the preparing time for this course is too short? I still miss the teaching style and assignment design of the first course of the series though. It would seem to be unwise to pay for the following courses if this continues on.(FYI I was the among the first ones who take this series, and I have got 100% grade for each course ever since then.)"
1327,WOX7001,Why don't you put it in the Data Structures course?
1328,WOX7001,"The course is too shallow - amount of topics discusses is quite small. Practice tasks are boring - implement pseudocode given in lectures. No quizzes. In particular you can see that it is a bad course, if you compare it to the previous 2 courses in the specialization. I'm agree with other people posting in forums about that.Wasted time, could spend that month more productively. Not going to continue passing other future courses."
1329,WOX7001,Thank you for a great course! But the assignments could have been more challenging.
1330,WOX7001,Good course!
1331,WOX7001,Good work ! Every concept is well explained !
1332,WOX7001,Neat and suitable examples for each topics.
1333,WOX7001,"Simply fantastic, to-the-point lectures with great insight to look at problems."
1334,WOX7001,"I can only give this two stars at most.The lecturers are just like reading the PPT without any heuristic teaching approaches.The assignments make me desperate, always show very poor feedback message -- ""Wrong answer"", even the cases failed because of performance issue.The starter files given from the assignment are inconsistent with the pdf description. It's so confusing.Couldn't get any help from forums."
1335,WOX7001,Excellent inputs on graph theoretic algorithms
1336,WOX7001,Good Course material and Assignment.
1337,WOX7001,Awesome! One of the rare courses that teach everything about Graphs! From the very basic to the very advanced. Together with programming assignments that accommodate almost all available programming languages!
1338,WOX7001,Course was to easy and nothing new in it not as the description that it has algorithms 100000 times faster than google.
1339,WOX7001,great course .... everything taught in order ... not so fast and not so slow
1340,WOX7001,"Prof. explains every algorithm design method such as D&C, DP, greedy very clear. Very nice class."
1341,WOX7001,"Brilliant course, very well taught."
1342,WOX7001,"really great,but it's a little bit difficult to me..."
1343,WOX7001,"Good course, every CS student should take."
1344,WOX7001,"Although I have taken algorithm courses before, I still learnt a lot from this course."
1345,WOX7001,"This course is awesome, the test bed for code is mind-blowing and engaging. Helped me get a job at Google and Amazon."
1346,WOX7001,Excellent introductory course on Algorithms.
1347,WOX7001,"As a developer without adequate CS educational background, it's very exciting and of great use to take this course. I've got the ""Algorithm in C (Parts 1-4)"" by Sedgewick and did some learning, but it's necessary for me to follow details and explanations from slides and video talks. Also the testing of coding assignment has covered several aspects which I have not paid attention in my daily work."
1348,WOX7001,"Wow, good lecturer, free of charge and great teaching experience!"
1349,WOX7001,Very useful class and you'd better read the book with this course to get more from it.
1350,WOX7001,Awesome course.
1351,WOX7001,"I started coding with Javascript and Python...and I struggled with this course, having not mastered Java. But the resources were perfect and now I have a large cache of projects and information to draw upon as I progress with Java and more academic/algorithmic problems in my software engineer career."
1352,WOX7001,"Very good. The TFs are nice too. Nevertheless for a non-CS student like me keeping up with the course is really tough, especially provided that I have never learnt java language before, and that I conducted all debugging without any debugger(I don't know how to use DrJava). In all the course is worth taking."
1353,WOX7001,"Great Course, great assignments, great teacher!"
1354,WOX7001,"It's a very good course, especially the design of homework."
1355,WOX7001,very Nice course. The best algorithm course in the world
1356,WOX7001,Best Course that one can take to sharpen his skills. Very thanks to Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne for coming up with this course. Before taking this course I used to think I have reached an end to my goal of learning Computer Science but now I feel the boat I was sailing was taking me in the wrong direction.
1357,WOX7001,"Awesome, Thanks a lot for providing free of cost"
1358,WOX7001,Best course on algorithm. Robert Sedgewick is awesome teacher.
1359,WOX7001,"Exceptionally good Lecturer and the course. Booksite, video materials and assignments are amazing. Would recommend this course to everyone! The only improvement i would suggest is the explanation of nearest neighbor search in KD tree. Critical information when to prune the search is not really explained so additional resources should be consulted."
1360,WOX7001,thanks ~
1361,WOX7001,The best course I have taken so far for introducing algorithms. I must say the exercises and programming interview questions made the course more interesting and thoroughly tested my understanding. Cheers to the instructors and the team !!!
1362,WOX7001,thanks，verygood......
1363,WOX7001,"I took this course to refresh my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge in order to prepare for technical interviews, and I'm glad I did. The lectures are great and the programming assignments are very well designed and have sufficient guidance. You really have to work on them. I would have liked more graded MCQs after lectures. This is also the first MOOC I've completed, and it gives me a great sense of accomplishment!"
1364,WOX7001,"Learn a lot from this course, including algorithm, data structure, Java programming. Get some great ideas. Expect for the Part 2 !"
1365,WOX7001,"Even though there is a lot of useful information in this course, I personally don’t like it. I wouldn’t take this course again if I had a chance to go back in time.All hometasks are much more about programing in Java than algorithms. Open any week's discussion forum, you will find out that 90% questions and problems are about Java, not algorithms. If you are not a professional programer, you will spend at least 30-40 hours a weak instead of 6-10 hours.5 week’s task is just a pure joke: 30 minutes explanation about most difficult structure in the course and not a single line of code.. After that you must write it by yourself. Just look at week 5 discussion forum. Do you know why there are 42 topics in week 3 and only 7 in week 5? Because people decide not to do it.The goal of a teacher must be to make students love the course\matherial\science, not to hate it. I’m not sure about hating, but it was annoying as hell."
1366,WOX7001,Exceptional slides and better teachers!
1367,WOX7001,This course is very informative and presents highly useful information in a manner that is easy to learn and remember. Everyone should take this course.
1368,WOX7001,great course！
1369,WOX7001,Fantastic hands-on course that helps you explore algorithms. You should be pretty comfortable with programming in Java (comfortable with creating linked data structures) to get the most of out of it.Assignments are incredibly well designed and allow you to make progress without much instructor. The discussion board is pretty responsive from other students in the course.A great supplement if you have taken/are taking an algorithm course without any programming assignments (or poorly structured programming assignments)
1370,WOX7001,Absolutely awesome course on data structure and algorithms. Very easy to understand. Nice figures and demos.
1371,WOX7001,very useful
1372,WOX7001,"A refreshing course for me, helped me to revise the stuff done long ago"
1373,WOX7001,"This was a great re-introduction to algorithms for a CS graduate. Great content, fast-paced and the forums were very helpful."
1374,WOX7001,"Topics are interesting, explanation is boring"
1375,WOX7001,a great course of algorithm!
1376,WOX7001,it's the best.
1377,WOX7001,"This course has an excellent structure. You get a real motivation, why you need algorithm, you understand how it works (with mathematical proof if it's not really complicated), its time/memory efficiency, and finally you practice it. Also, you can learn some Java through this course. I really like how Robert Sedgewick explains course material. Thanks for this experience."
1378,WOX7001,An excellent course taught by a living legend.
1379,WOX7001,Excellent course. Definitely one of the best out there. Professor Sedgewick does an excellent job getting ideas across.
1380,WOX7001,Increadibly good. This is the level that all online courses should strive towards.
1381,WOX7001,Very completely!
1382,WOX7001,"Really good course, very much helpful."
1383,WOX7001,"Great overview course. I have taken algorithms in college, and I am currently a software developer, but I have found this tremendously useful to review the material (especially good for interview prep!). I even gain a better understanding of concepts I thought I knew well already. The professor explains everything in a concise and thorough manner, the homeworks are well thought out, and the hints are helpful. The only improvement I could think of for the course would be to make the lecture sound a bit quieter during the few times the professor would cough -- the mic distortions can be a little annoying. Overall, highly recommend this course to anyone looking to learn basics of algorithms or review the material for interviews or general understanding."
1384,WOX7001,Great course and assignments!
1385,WOX7001,"The course is very difficult, but the quality is excellent. Due to the stringent grading of the program submissions, I believe more help should offered for each assignment."
1386,WOX7001,"it's very nice to explain about what you should learn,and much。。。"
1387,WOX7001,"As a ten year old Engineer, I recommend every engineer need carefully review at this."
1388,WOX7001,Great way of explaining the topics
1389,WOX7001,"A superb course, the video and lectures are top class. The exercises are challenging and well set."
1390,WOX7001,The auto-graders provide lots of detailed feedback and make working on the assignments a very positive part of the course.
1391,WOX7001,Really good course to start learning algorithm at advanced level.
1392,WOX7001,"I like this course, the slide and reference book are excellent, and the program exercise let me use the algorithms to solve the interesting problems, let me understand the algorithms more deeply, let me make more efficient code and take care of my code style and the memory usage. Wow, so wonderful, thank you!"
1393,WOX7001,Excellently clear and thorough introduction to algorithms. Prof. Sedgewick has superb learning skills.
1394,WOX7001,really good. I just cannot come up with a course that is better than this. great slides and great project
1395,WOX7001,A very good course!
1396,WOX7001,What an outstanding treatment of the basic algorithms! 5*.
1397,WOX7001,"Excellent course. As an engineering grad who has only done scientific programming in the past, this course really got me thinking about programming in a different way. I had no experience with Java before taking this course, and it was very doable having had mostly only Python and Matlab experience previously. However, if you do not have Java experience, I highly recommend learning basic Java structure and syntax before starting. The course recommends the Duke Object Oriented Programming course, but when I tried it, I found it confusing, slow, and unhelpful from the get go. This web page ended up working great for me because of my background in Python: http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/java4python/index.htm. Also, I highly, highly recommend downloading a Java IDE (I used Netbeans)."
1398,WOX7001,Great class
1399,WOX7001,Awesome course.. focusing mainly on developing algorithmic thinking instead of simply knowing it
1400,WOX7001,"excellent course, a must for all CS students or any one else who is interested in programming"
1401,WOX7001,"Wow, great course, one of the best in Coursera! I enjoyed the lectures a lot, they are engaging and fast paced, the examples of practical applications are interesting; the assignments and interview questions are well thought and challenging.Thanks so much to the Princeton professors who decided to make this amazing material available online. The course is so good I had to buy Sedgewick and Wayne's Algorithms book, not because it was needed for the course (it is not, you have all you need in the lectures), but because they totally rock! Thanks!"
1402,WOX7001,"Very good course, and tough too, you need good amount of efforts everyday."
1403,WOX7001,Awesome course
1404,WOX7001,Should be followed by every people who say is a programmer
1405,WOX7001,Very amazing course.
1406,WOX7001,I really like this course. It is a good recap of algorithms which I learned in my masters. Reasons for going to further approach and examples are given good. I feel if more real time examples are provided it will be good for students to understand where they can apply these algorithms or they can implement their own algorithms.
1407,WOX7001,"The course was really good in giving real time examples of the algorithms and its usability in the real world ,the course should also have offered few more assignment covering each topic in the assignments using every component of the course!"
1408,WOX7001,"Learned a lot from this course, great contents and projects."
1409,WOX7001,very interesting course!
1410,WOX7001,Enjoyable course and challenging assignments !
1411,WOX7001,"Because I don't know Java (yet) and the homework can only be submitted in Java, I audited this course. Time well spent! Even without working the exercises, the lectures were easy to follow and highly interesting. I picked up several things that will likely help me write better code."
1412,WOX7001,"One of the best courses I've ever had. Breathtaking, exciting, absorbing!"
1413,WOX7001,Great course! Very informative!
1414,WOX7001,"One of the best courses I've taken so far, related to Computer Science fundamentals. if you need to master data structures and algorithms, this is the course for you."
1415,WOX7001,"Really exceptional course. Thank you so much for making this available for free, for the time spent by the professor creating this and the mentors helping out the students."
1416,WOX7001,Great course. It is the best Algorithm course I have ever seen. Lectures with amazing animations are very enjoyable. Cannot wait for the Algorithms Part II.
1417,WOX7001,Thank you very much.
1418,WOX7001,"Very interesting, efficient and exciting course! The best themes for me were search algorithms and BST."
1419,WOX7001,Really clear explanation for every algorithm. The exercises are quite challenging and helpful!
1420,WOX7001,great course to learn basic algorithm as well as understand the logic and reason behind them
1421,WOX7001,It's a great course!
1422,WOX7001,"Absolutely wonderful course! Especially the lectures given by Robert! Thanks a lot to Robert, Kevin, and Coursera and all the staff! For this! This is my first Online course ever! And my experience was great all together! Thanks a lot. :D"
1423,WOX7001,It's a really great course with clear lectures and pretty practical homework. Highly recommended!
1424,WOX7001,"So good that I would certainly recommend it, the lessons are clear and cut. The assignments are very meaningful and demanding."
1425,WOX7001,"The contents are extremely useful, and the lecture is clear. The programming assignments are challenging."
1426,WOX7001,"The assignments are extremely challenging and enjoyable. The videos can get a bit confusing, but overall a great course."
1427,WOX7001,"I used this course for recollection of what I learned at the uni long time ago. It helped me to fill the gaps I'd naturally developed since then, as I don't need that low level understanding algorithms in my everyday work. The course definitely serves these purposes."
1428,WOX7001,good course with new things that exite my tech soul
1429,WOX7001,This course is amazing! The course lectures are well explained and the assignments pose a good challenge.
1430,WOX7001,Great course. The programming assignments helped to reinforce the concepts.
1431,WOX7001,a good and informative course.
1432,WOX7001,Very applicable algorithms course!
1433,WOX7001,"Great content, very well explained, great exercises too."
1434,WOX7001,"This is perfect course. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to get basic experience in data structures and algorithms. Thanks to professors Robert Sedgewick, professor Kevin Wayne and all who made it available."
1435,WOX7001,Excellent course. well rounded.
1436,WOX7001,very helpful
1437,WOX7001,"Overall, very good course. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star course is the lack of resources around comparing completed programming assignments."
1438,WOX7001,"This is a great course and the practical assignments are really cool. But I would like to have more assignments where we have to implement the data structures ourselves, because I thing the best way to learn an algorithms is by going throw the process of implementing and debugging it"
1439,WOX7001,Great and challenging course to learn data structures and algorithms.
1440,WOX7001,This was a fantastic course. I was hoping for a simple review but I learned some new material too. I really excited for part 2.
1441,WOX7001,Very helpful! Pretty challenging assignments and well organized lectures. Looking forward to the second part!
1442,WOX7001,Pretty good course for the first time java programmer. It covers most of the basic algorithms required to understand by a computer scientist. Really like the idea of place introduction of iterator and comparator within this class. It really boost my understanding of JAVA programming language. Would like to recommend this course to all my classmate. It helps!
1443,WOX7001,"Very challenge though, also help me learn a lot through the five projects. High recommend."
1444,WOX7001,"while(1==1)S.o.p(""Awesome"");this course is a must do.Thanks Sirs, Thanks Coursera."
1445,WOX7001,one of the greatest things I have go through..........
1446,WOX7001,"Great course. Reminded me why I enjoy programming. Lots of updated material, and better instruction than in person, at university, a long time ago :-)"
1447,WOX7001,"My skills in Java were not at the level they needed to be to do the course, but I learned a lot. Thanks!"
1448,WOX7001,Great course
1449,WOX7001,Great course thanks!
1450,WOX7001,"An excellent course. I have learnt a huge amount about algorithms. Really, really good!!"
1451,WOX7001,"Very detailed and good explanations. Priceless when the teacher can explain why red-black trees are called red-black, because they invented it. :)"
1452,WOX7001,Very good content
1453,WOX7001,Very informative and helpful!!
1454,WOX7001,"I have had a great experience during the course. Thank you very much, I have learned a lot of useful things."
1455,WOX7001,Very effective
1456,WOX7001,Excellent course for beginners and experienced programmers
1457,WOX7001,Strongly recommended!This course clearly introduces the basic algorithms and data structures to the students. The professor not only explains the concept of the algorithms but also shows us the applications of them. The homework of this course is substantial and deep. It is really worthwhile to spend time on the homework.
1458,WOX7001,Great!
1459,WOX7001,"Thanks a lot for this course. Very interesting. Practical tasks very useful, somewhat challenging."
1460,WOX7001,Very interesting and clear. Great value.
1461,WOX7001,One of the best courses on Coursera. Elegantly explained concepts and detailed material makes this course a must-do for every Computer Science enthusiast.
1462,WOX7001,This is the best algorithms course i have ever seen before. The homework assignments are fantastic.
1463,WOX7001,Very good course!
1464,WQD7001,I can learn why we should code like that and the method to solve the problem
1465,WQD7001,"Great course, assignments and job interview questions are the best part of it"
1466,WQD7001,"Great course, benefit a lot ! And I will absolutely continue learning algorithms, Part II."
1467,WQD7001,Its pretty good!
1468,WQD7001,"I really enjoyed this course. The material and videos were carefully made and very informative. The assignments were made that you can properly use the content learned from the lessons. The mentor/instructors are very knowledgeable. It goes without saying the instructors are reference in the Algorithms field.It is worth saying the assignments may require you to research extra resources, e.g. Algorithms 4th book."
1469,WQD7001,"I have never studied such a good algorithms class starting from very basics. The best thing which I like most was Java implementations of every piece of algorithms of basic data structures. All videos lectures have detailed explanation of topics. Just a suggestion that - time and space complexity explanations could have been in more detailed so as to understand easily by a novice. Although, the programming quiz questions were difficult, they require every chunk of knowledge you have just studied. Also, adding interview questions related to chapter with hints after your trial and MCQs after every small lectures were charm to the course. I am sincerely looking forward to enroll in other courdses as well. Thank you so much Coursera team, Robert and Kevin."
1470,WQD7001,Excellent lectures and hard enough programming assignments. Highly recommended.
1471,WQD7001,"Probably one of the best courses on this whole website. The prof and accompanying textbook and website are clear and fairly concise. The assignments are challenging but fair and the autograder works really well so you get instant feedback.Probably the only con is having to setup up Java on your computer which can be a pain,"
1472,WQD7001,"Typical question of novice of programming: What language should I learn first?Typical answer is incorrect, sadly.Correct answer is: It doesn't matter. Algorithms and patterns matters. I'm not sure about patterns, but Donald Knuth and Robert Sedgewick are best at algorithms. And here you have unique possibility to learn from the best. Rush for it! And be prepared, it won't be easy.And many thanks to Kevin Wayne for his fundamental job. Probably he is the one who we should thank for this great opportunity to learn it here, on coursera."
1473,WQD7001,Good start course for digging into cs world
1474,WQD7001,Wonderful course !!!! describing efficient basic Algorithms.
1475,WQD7001,Course yang bagus
1476,WQD7001,The course is good refresher as well as advanced to meet enterprise needs.
1477,WQD7001,"great course, easy to understand!"
1478,WQD7001,great introduction course in algorithms
1479,WQD7001,It is very important course but i hope the videos included Arabic subtitle
1480,WQD7001,"Excellent course, concepts are very well explained, with ample amounts of examples. I also really enjoyed how the professor showed real world examples of how the data structures/algorithms are used, so that we aren't learning all this stuff in a vacuum."
1481,WQD7001,Changed my way of thinking. Thank you!
1482,WQD7001,Great course!Cons: too java oriented.
1483,WQD7001,Very Good Content Flow..Thank you.
1484,WQD7001,My programming skills reached new heights. Thank you!
1485,WQD7001,Great course from great professors. Definitly must-have for any software developer.
1486,WQD7001,"Great course. Sedgewick has good educational skills. The course also contains good examples and interesting assignments. I struggled a bit with the first assignments, but then I liked the last 2 better. Looking forward to part 2."
1487,WQD7001,Exceptional Course!But a good knowledge and programming experience in Java is highly recommended.
1488,WQD7001,The course was very good. The content was explained well. The assignments were the best part. Looking forward to completing the second part of the course.
1489,WQD7001,Very good course. Enjoyed it greatly. Wish I had more time to immerse myself in the optional content and practice questions more.
1490,WQD7001,complex concepts explained simply !
1491,WQD7001,Highly useful course and assignments. Professor teaches great techniques to writing a clean and concise code.
1492,WQD7001,This course is incredible.
1493,WQD7001,It would be very helpful to let us see the forums of previous sessions.
1494,WQD7001,great.hope i will continue to learn untill the end.
1495,WQD7001,A gorgeous cource! I've enjoyed while studying.I learned a lot of new.Thanks!
1496,WQD7001,Wonderful couse for computer scientists.
1497,WQD7001,-
1498,WQD7001,"very good course, and the assignments are very challenge"
1499,WQD7001,"I had long expected to have some free time to attend this course,and now I finally did it. It's simply great with practical demo and assignments at the end of each week to test the skills acquired.For sure I am going to attend the second part of the course."
1500,WQD7001,"This course gives a very good overview of algorithms, justifying each new data structure or technique by examining the performance and technical problems that it is trying to solve, and explaining the meaning of the approach. It is a good idea to do a good bit of coding on your own, however, as the Assignments typically expect you to USE the data structures explained in the lectures from a static library rather than hand-coded."
1501,WQD7001,Great course to understand algorithms!
1502,WQD7001,"The course gave me excellent insights and it helped me to improve my java skills.The overall presentation (learning material, videos, assignment) is very professionial and good to understand.It would be nice to allow a look at how other students solved the assignments. Maybe with an anonymized grading. Or some kind of a master solution to see, how the best solution to an assignnment would look like."
1503,WQD7001,This a very interesting and well-organized course!
1504,WQD7001,Very interesting and not so hard. Interview questions are sometimes trickier than practical exercises.
1505,WQD7003,Very helpful and detailed
1506,WQD7003,Great course. Made me complete many missing points in my programming knowledge. I look forward to see the part 2. Thank you.
1507,WQD7003,Amazing experience. Well structured course with a lot of interesting information.
1508,WQD7003,-
1509,WQD7003,It makes the algorithms more simple and interesting.
1510,WQD7003,"This course is very helpful with me. It helps me review a lot of materials about algorithms I've learn from my university. Thanks professors and other members for a great course. If you want to solid your knowledge, don't hesitate to take this course, it's total worth it."
1511,WQD7003,Excellent introduction to thinking formally about how to program effectively
1512,WQD7003,That is a great course
1513,WQD7003,Very interesting course ! It gives a good knowledge about basic data structures and algorithms used in every day programming. Thanks to course authors !
1514,WQD7003,Thank you Very helpfull
1515,WQD7003,there should be more problem statements for preparation
1516,WQD7003,"Amazing course from an inspiring instructor. The course material is excellent. The assignments are demanding, but totally worth the time spent. Thank you for this course!"
1517,WQD7003,Great course to learn or refresh the algorithmic core!
1518,WQD7003,"The best algorithms course. The video lectures are very good. Prof.Sedgewick builds the concepts very well. The code examples/library written by Prof. Wayne and Prof. Sedgewick's code are very compact and the best I have seen. The online website is great supplement to the book. The auto grader is air tight, that forces the student to think and write their code to the specs. My greatest appreciations for Prof. Wayne and Prof. Sedgewick. I wish students have the option to submit their solutions in C++ because in most of the languages the core algorithms/data structures are often written in c/c++ , I understand it is not easy because the course libraries and grader has to written for c++."
1519,WQD7003,I think it is a good course. I have known more about time complexity of algorithms and some applications of different kinds of the algorithms. I have spent more time then I though for this course.
1520,WQD7003,"Brilliant! I started the Algorithms course with not insubstantial software experience. However, I last took data structures over 10 years ago and decided to give myself a 'refresher' since my area of specialization rarely utilizes structures such as BST's or hash tables.The assignments are 'just right' in applying algorithmic concepts and real-world technical rigor. The problems are focused and contained to fit busy schedules, but, at the same time, challenging enough to provide a sense of accomplishment and to see practical applicability."
1521,WQD7003,What a great opportunity to take a course from one of the pioneers of computer science. The lectures are perfectly paced and inspiring.
1522,WQD7003,I really enjoyed this course. It was not easy. But it was fun. Now moving on to Part II. :)
1523,WQD7003,Great course! You really learn to program efficiently. Material very well presented to understand the stuff.
1524,WQD7003,"Very solid course. Well explained and informative content and straightforward algorithm illustrations. It not only explains and analyzes mechanism of algorithms, but also offers a set of very practical Java implementations. The weekly programming assignment is awesome. They are well-designed and closely related to real-world application. This is a extraordinary course and I enthusiastically recommend it."
1525,WQD7003,"Fantastic course, very appreciate for the Professor and all the contributors of this course. I have learnt so much!"
1526,WQD7003,As for non-native English speaker and programmer amateur this course is literally a godsend! Thank you!
1527,WQD7003,"Fun, engaging, and clearly explained"
1528,WQD7003,"I learned a lot about algorithms, the best approaches to solving them, and coding them to use the Big-O notation."
1529,WQD7003,"This course is an excellent introduction to thinking about algorithms and data structures.It is challenging, in that the assignments can feel overwhelming, but the discussion forums are an excellent place to ask for any clarification.The videos are very helpful, consistent, and well-paced, and the instructor is incredibly knowledgeable and articulate."
1530,WQD7003,Excellent course. I would like a similar one but using C++ to learn even more. Congratulations on this great effort you make.
1531,WQD7003,"Great open course. Easy to understand, and I really learned a lot from this course."
1532,WQD7003,"A great introduction to fundamental algorithms. This course is very well thought-out, the instructor always makes his points very clearly an convincingly: more than just algorithms, this course transmits a way of thinking about them. The material is very well polished, you can feel the instructor has been teaching this topic for so many years. In addition to all of this, the programming assignments' topic are generally quite exciting."
1533,WQD7003,This course is pretty good.Algorithms' processing is clear in slide and teacher also explain well.I learned how to design API for data structure.I think it is important.
1534,WQD7003,Very interesting course. The basic algorithms learned here are very useful. For game development and big data analysis.
1535,WQD7003,Excellent Course. Very interesting.
1536,WQD7003,awesome introductory course on algorithm!
1537,WQD7003,"Brilliant course, hope that some materials such as some smart design (back flush in lesson 1,etc.) could be documented. Thank you dear professor"
1538,WQD7003,Very good course. It really helped me to understand what is the algorithm complexity and how to estimate it.
1539,WQD7003,"It was a terrific course, and I learnt a lot. The lectures were very interesting, and the assignments were engrossing."
1540,WQD7003,Challenging and interesting assignments. Recommend for those with basic programming background.
1541,WQD7003,Great instructor. Amazing auto-grader. Interesting content. I want to take more courses like this.
1542,WQD7003,Very good Course.
1543,WQD7003,Extremely well designed course. The assignments touch all the concepts taught in the class. Lot of concepts get clarified when you try to reach 100% on each assignment. Highly recommend this course.
1544,WQD7003,I learned so much from this course. Thank you. I will recommend it to all my friends.
1545,WQD7003,it's really a fantastic course!
1546,WQD7003,This is a great course of algorithms I have ever seen . great!
1547,WQD7003,The course lost a lot without tests. Theory is great. Assignments are pain in the azz - too much is assumed here and there. You must resubmit like a dozen of times to figure out what is wrong.
1548,WQD7003,"Super course! I love all the assignments. and the upload-and-feedback system. The lectures are also very good. I did not use the interview questions.Getting the course done in time and working full time simultaneously is very hard, though, but I don't really have any programming experience with me, so that might make it harder."
1549,WQD7003,The best.
1550,WQD7003,"I really like this course. I think the pace of video is appropriate, clearly explaining the main knowledge of each part but not digging into details too much. for me,I never learned algorithm or java before, but I can mostly grab the lecture content. Another reason I like about the course is the amazing programming assignment part. Each assignment is a little bit challenging but not overwhelming and you can exactly know how well you did through the precisely computing grader system. Thanks for such a wonderful CS course!"
1551,WQD7003,"This is an exceptional course - best I have seen, in fact. I'm excited to take Part 2 (and buy the book). Thanks very much to Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne for putting together such an amazing learning resource and making it freely available."
1552,WQD7003,Good course and assignements(make you think). I liked it.
1553,WQD7003,Awesome course! The best I ever seen.
1554,WQD7003,very useful
1555,WQD7003,The best course on real life algorithms and theirs application.
1556,WQD7003,Great for course.
1557,WQD7003,"Excellent course, clearly explained lectures and interesting programming assignments."
1558,WQD7003,Great course. I'm really glad I took it.
1559,WQD7003,"This course is pretty good, for part 1, the lecturer covered some basic and essential things in algorithms and data structure. Everything is presented in a clear order."
1560,WQD7003,"Great lectures, great programming assignments and grading, overall I really enjoyed this course. I tried to get through it 2 other times and finally had the time & patience to do it and I'm so glad I did. Thank you!"
1561,WQD7003,"The grading system is very helpful for debuggingA little suggestion, personally i would not go to the forum unless i meet problems, but actually i find i may missed some great thinking for ignoring it. It would be better if there is a subscription feature like what's trending on the Forum to reminder learners to participate in the discussion.And i like the every week's interview question, thank you for all your effort!"
1562,WQD7003,"Great course, really enjoyed it - opened my eyes to the performance implications of the code I write!"
1563,WQD7003,Excellent lectures with very structured yet interesting contents. The homeworks are very useful!
1564,WQD7003,"Great, Thanks all"
1565,WQD7003,Great explanations and very good assignments.
1566,WQD7003,Great course!
1567,WQD7003,"Good course for a free one. Thank you for all of your great work. Somehow, the pace is too fast. Covering about 2 sections per week is by far too hard to read the book along with the class. There's no practice exercise to strengthen what you learn. The assignment is very hard and sometime don't directly implement the knowledge you learn in that week. Sometime the video sound is too quiet (but you can read the transcript when it happened.) The book is better in my opinion."
1568,WQD7003,Would be great to have a certificate
1569,WQD7003,There is very informative course. It has understandable explanation of algorithms and data structures.
1570,WQD7003,Great lectures!
1571,WQD7003,This is the best course for learning Algorithms
1572,WQD7003,It is the best algorithms course I have ever taken.
1573,WQD7003,Did this course second time but still felt i learned a lot new. Amazing work in creating the course so educative and structured.
1574,WQD7003,"very nice!It will be better if we can be offered some quiz and feedback,not only coding assignment."
1575,WQD7003,Very useful. This is the best course I've had done in my school
1576,WQD7003,Great course!
1577,WQD7003,Exceptionally good. I am a working professional with 13+ years of development experience and still found this course to be full of high value and knowledge. I really never looked at these algorithms the way it is represented in this course. I am very thankful to Coursera and Princeton University for making this course available to everyone.
1578,WQD7003,"I really liked the videos and the lecture slides. I think the assignments were really good as well, but had the feeling sometimes small but important informations were missing or not placed well enough. I read the description for the 8puzzle half a dozen times, but that this is not actually solving the task in the optimal amount of moves but rather in some arbitrary amount of moves (we just output the optimal moves) somehow escaped my attention."
1579,WQD7003,This course is very systematic about basic algorithms and theoretical knowledge about analysis.
1580,WQD7003,This course is helpful
1581,WQD7003,Outstanding! Would recommend this class to anyone interested in software construction.
1582,WQD7003,This course is simply fantastic. The instructor's code is most elegant code I have ever seen and it was very illuminating to see how these fundamental algorithms are being implemented in such an elegant and efficient way.
1583,WQD7003,"Excellent course. One of the best courses I have taken from coursera. Very well explained, with a lot of implementations in Java."
1584,WQD7003,"I enrolled this course last year and quit at week 3. But I finished it this time and it's the first CS MOOC I finished. It's a really hard but really worthful six-week. It led me into the world of algorithm and helped me improved my English a lot.Thanks to Sedgewick's gorgeous lectures, Wayne's patient answers at Discuss forum and every fellows participate this course."
1585,WQD7003,The best fundamental data structure and algorithms course I have ever experienced.
1586,WQD7003,"Loved it, basic knowledge for any serious programmer"
1587,WQD7003,It was an amazing experience. Many thanks for such a good theoretical information and challenging practice. Every single time I had one question - can I do better. Knowledge obtained from this course is outstanding. Thank you again
1588,WQD7003,amazing class! the best class that I have ever seen!
1589,WQD7003,"I find Prof. Sedgewicks' moderately paced lectures very concise and easy to follow. His animated demo of each algorithm clearly demonstrates how the algorithm works. I find the problem sets challenging and fun, and finally finding an optimized solution as very rewarding, especially when I get the bonus scores. While this course uses Java as the programming language, I find the concepts quite easy to apply in other programming languages such as C. Thank you very much course staff for offering this excellent course for free here at Coursera!"
1590,WQD7003,the professor is very kind. strongly recommend this course.
1591,WQD7003,Good course!
1592,WQD7003,"Challenging, but a greater refresher on some core Computer Science topics."
1593,WQD7003,"It makes me learn so much,thank you so much."
1594,WQD7003,"Great course. As for me it is ideal. I dont have a CS degree, but works as java developer. The course shows me the beauty of algorithms!"
1595,WQD7004,"I've been through several courses over the past year, some really good, some pretty poor, both here and on Edx, but this one has really no match to find. I would recommend this to anyone, and especially to those planning on creating a MOOC, as this one is really a state of the art :)"
1596,WQD7004,Strongly Recommend For Algorithm Study！
1597,WQD7004,Great!
1598,WQD7004,Homeworks are super fun and challenging!The lectures are super clear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1599,WQD7004,Simply Awesome.
1600,WQD7004,"The material and the teaching method are absolutely amazing. Not just a course for algorithms, but a course on ""how to teach a course right"" .. very thankful to the instructors and facilitators."
1601,WQD7004,Great course from Professor Robert Sedgewick. Strongly recommend.
1602,WQD7004,"One of the best courses I have taken Coursera, edX or any MOOC provider. I will definately follow the algorithm path (Alg I, Alg II, Analysis of Algorithms)"
1603,WQD7004,The course is a quality course for anyone wanting to learn algorithms(especially in Java).
1604,WQD7004,very useful course
1605,WQD7004,Great.
1606,WQD7004,I'm taking this for the second time to strengthen my knowledge. The course is one of the best I've taking online in the past few years. This is one of the courses I would pay money for because it is very valuable to me.
1607,WQD7004,Good course course with good instruction from professors
1608,WQD7004,it‘s a nice course
1609,WQD7004,"In one word, It's awesome course"
1610,WQD7004,Excellent beginning for some one who wants to understands algorithms.
1611,WQD7004,"Thank you for creating this course. It simply, step by step explains concepts in algorithms."
1612,WQD7004,"Interesting material, but its presentation is haphazard and incomprehensible. In typical Latin American style, the presenter wanders erratically through the material in the videos in a confusing and non-linear way, so that making coherent notes is impossible. The relationship between the video, quiz and supplemental reading is sometimes hard to determine. The workload is also vastly different from week to week, including one reading of over 200 pages, indeed a whole book - whilst other lectures demanded only a few pages' worth. Sadly this course was one I abandoned - I lost patience with its random and frustrating structure and the limiting and perplexing nature of the quizzes. I should point out I am bilingual so this was by no means a language issue. If you have the patience for this, or are used to this style of learning, go ahead. I've had to stop, sadly."
1613,WQD7004,Ha sido un curso muy interesante y útil. Lo recomiendo para saber como América Larina funciona en estos momentos. Los documentos adjuntos son extremadamente necesarios para disfrutar del curso!It was so interesting and useful. I recomend it to know about how Latin America is working at this moment. The attached files are extremly needed to enjoy the course!
1614,WQD7004,This course should retrieved from Coursera. It is plenty of mistakes. One of the quiz is repeated. Questions do not have relation with lectures.
1615,WQD7004,"videos can be more interactive with more information on the slides. feel that slides downloaded is not worth the time. I seem to see the professor on screen more then important information we need to take note of. Some modules need to go indepth explanation but does not, especially on"
1616,WQD7004,Great course with very practical real-life examples. Highly recomended
1617,WQD7004,"A good introduction, though I would have appreciated more readings or suggestions on where to look into the topics in more depth (particularly the Financial Services Metrics). It was disorienting to not use actual data sets in the final peer assessment."

1640,WQD7005,Peer Reviewers seem too keen to take marks off or dont bother reading the assignment
1641,WQD7005,"It was new and good expirience for me. However, I expect to see more alculations and practical tasks. To calculate smthn, to make some conclusion from it. To analize results."

1646,WQD7005,very good course. best explanation on financial models i have ever seen!!!! learn about sharpe ratio etc in the most visual and simplest explanation you will ever seen in the whole internet and youtube.
1647,WQD7005,i really enjoyed the course and learn a lot of things about business analysis and how to distinguish between different metrics and which of them can we use for immediate changing in business processes
1648,WQD7005,Awesome Class! Having fun with DATA!
1649,WQD7005,Why were we talking about money managers and hedge funds? What does that have to do with data analytics for business? I never saw the connection and they never explained it.
1650,WQD7005,"This was a good introductory course, with some very informative video and instruction. I only give it 3 stars because I felt it really lacked interactivity. Although quizzes were required throughout, I felt too much of the class was simply sitting back and watching lectures."
1651,WQD7005,good to understand a broad concept of business metrics
1652,WQD7005,Great intro course!
1653,WQD7005,"It's the first course from the specification, which makes us better understand the necessary business metrics for data-driven companies, and it is a good entry for following modules. Help me a lot."
1654,WQD7005,Good basic intro to business metrics
1655,WQD7005,"I love Dr. Egger's way of teaching, however the videos could use some updates. There are errors that were pointed out 5 years ago on the message board, but they have still not been corrected."
1656,WQD7005,"The scope of the course is very broad, but very insightful."
1657,WQD7005,"I had a wonderful experience of learning what I am interested in on this interactive, user-friendly online platform Coursera and received my first certificate. Great course hold by Duke University, which allowed me to systematically understand the business analytics, data analysis and some innovative ways of marketing. The course goes deep into details in this field, while truly require no additional knowledge before enrolling based, I could proudly tell you based on my first-hand experience. I spent several hours every week during this month to study the course, and really this was a good memory. ^_^"
1658,WQD7005,Great course that helped me understand business metrics in a more systematic way. The peer reviews were great as well.
1659,WQD7005,Amazing course! I learned a lot!! Thank you!!
1660,WQD7005,"Course was great. Not sure I agree with all the peer grading I received, but the instruction was excellent."
1661,WQD7005,Interesting course but I would have appreciated some exercises with more data to analyse (maybe more practical case). I don't understand the correlation with Aribnb ...
1662,WQD7005,Content was a bit shallower than expected.
1663,WQD7005,I think this is a great course. The lectures are enjoyable and you are guaranteed to take something away. I very much liked Professor's Egger's way of delivering the video lectures. Not even one can be called boring. I hope the specialization builds on to the fabulous start.
1664,WQD7005,"easy to understand. One suggestion is that it is too simple for students who have business background, add more knowledge and more supporting materials for self-studying will be better! Thanks a lot for this course!"
1665,WQD7005,good course
1666,WQD7005,Excellent course to introduce the concepts of business analytics.
1667,WQD7005,"Very thoroughly taught, with many business processes introduced and explained. I have a much better idea of how businesses can use data analytics to improve their sales, profitability, and operations. The quizzes are doable, but not a breeze, and requires review of the course material for a complete understanding and a good grade. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn how data analytics actually function in real world scenarios."
1668,WQD7005,I enjoyed this class very much!
1669,WQD7005,The course has been very beneficial to me in that it has given me a deeper insight into data analysis and how it is harnessed by companies.
1670,WQD7005,A very good introduction that moves at the right pace
1671,WQD7005,Good to get an understanding of a Business Analyst / Business Data Analyst / Data Scientist job.Financial concepts brought seem a bit out of place in the context of this specific course though.
1672,WQD7005,informative videos. useful final project
1673,WQD7005,I enjoyed this course so much that I am trying to save the transcript so I can read it when I can.I love Dr. Egger's explanation as always and enthusiasm as well in teaching this course. I would like to complete the coursework if I can.Please keep up the good work! I am not a student of Duke University but I felt being one because of this opportunity to study under Dr. Egger's wing. Thank you again.

1675,WQD7005,Very intresting course and very usefull!!!
1676,WQD7005,"Great Course to understand the key principles in business analysis, especially traditional and dynamic business metrics"
1677,WQD7005,"Overall I feel the course provided sufficient material to understand the concepts and terminology. For some of the data analysis terms, I feel that practice problems and step by step guides should be provided."
1678,WQD7005,Great course for beginners in Business Metrics
1679,WQD7005,"This course is not about Excel or MYSQL. This is only about Probability distribution, binary classification etc. So, if you're interested in learning some Math, this is a great course for you. But certainly not for learning some basic Excel and MYSQL. I am very disappointed and have lost all my money for nothing. I did not learn what I had initially thought I will. I feel cheated, I have lost both time and money at the same time."

1684,WQD7006,Easy and pointless.
1685,WQD7006,"Great start to the certificate. Sometimes the industry-based case studies seemed jarring--could use a slightly better T-up. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it!"
1686,WQD7006,"Excellent course, full with analytical examples, and a thorough approach on the subject with explanation of a lot of economical terms."
1687,WQD7006,The course is good way to start the Data Analytics. Everyone before venturing into Data Analytics with lot off doubts should attend this course and it will clear the doubts.The teaching team should provide some downloadable slides of the text shown during the presentations. Coursera can recommend for slides similar to slides in Entrepreneurship Course provided by Wharton Online.
1688,WQD7006,It helps to identify clearly the metrics you need for each situation
1689,WQD7006,The course is insightful as it offers real world analysis and inform web companies' techniques.

1694,WQD7006,"The course really gives you a great introduction to business metrics. It builds on a foundation of examples an then shows us how to apply.

1705,WQD7006,this course is very useful

1712,WQD7006,"Quizzes don't match what's been taught in the video lectures. Very poorly-designed questions, where there is more than one correct answer."
1713,WQD7006,"This was a fantastic course, and I am continuing to complete the certificate program."
1714,WQD7006,General Introduction but it is a very interesting topic!
1715,WQD7007,It is just awesome!
1716,WQD7007,"Good overall. Some of the material was very basic, but it does give a good foundation to build on. I recommend it."

1725,WQD7007,Teachers are excellent!
1726,WQD7007,"Extremely informative course. I found the lectures easy to follow and well organized. I did not pay for the course so I have no feedback from quizzes and thus have no way of being sure I really understand the material as well as I think I do. Other than that, two thumbs up"
1727,WQD7007,Survey course. Excited to apply the knowledge and learn concrete skills in the upcoming courses within this specialization.
1728,WQD7007,It's very general information. The explanation movies are great.
1729,WQD7007,"The course is good, gives you all the basic knowledge you need for applying business metrics. The best part about it which I liked was that it doesn't give you a list of business metrics to mug up instead concepts of creating a metrics and their application are explained which helps us in coming up with our own metrics in real life applications"
1730,WQD7007,"Great summaries, good lectures"

1740,WQD7007,Excellent course to get an insight of Data related tasks and profession
1741,WQD7007,"This was a very basic foundation course on data careers and business metrics. Gives a lot of examples of companies and their varying levels of need for data employees. There is a short segment in here on Financial services which i found to be a bit misplaced, and I would have liked more detail on the business metrics side as well as on the financial services side (if it is indeed well placed and I just didn't catch the correlation)."
1742,WQD7007,Course is useful for analysts.
1743,WQD7007,I learned relevant business metrics and its classification.
1744,WQD7007,Was great! I learn a lot of valuable topics that I am using on a daily basis!

1749,WQD7007,"Very good course, only 1 BIG disadvantage: you cannot take the quizzes unless you buy the certificate..."

1752,WQD7007,I learned very interesting things. Thank you

1754,WQD7007,Excellent and informative
1755,WQD7008,Great Course. I enjoyed being introduced to Business Metrics while taking this class.
1756,WQD7008,Lovely. It is a good introduction to the subject explored in this set of courses and a subtle reminder of some stuff I learned on my MBA.
1757,WQD7008,Highly informative adoptable knowledge to learn for any Business Manager.
1758,WQD7008,This course was very helpful. I am engineering with no background in business but it introduced it in an easy way. I have gained a lot of information. and understood clearly. I googled things but that enhances the learning process. Thanks for this course
1759,WQD7008,I liked the course. I give 4 stars because as I noticed some of the course content wasn't updated even if almost one year ago people issued that some calculations given by professor are wrong.
1760,WQD7008,Excellent course! Highly recommended
1761,WQD7008,"Pretty good overview for simple business metrics definitions and basic level analysis. It is a good refresher for those with an analytics background, but also puts things in a perspective from a business setting which is good for when you are working in the field."
1762,WQD7008,Basic introduction to data analytics
1763,WQD7008,"The metrics introduce is broad, but it helps you with the idea of how businesses function in this modern world.

1765,WQD7008,"I was really interesting and helpful at my work, Thank you!"

1771,WQD7008,Effective!
1772,WQD7008,Despite it's simplicity the course lays the groundwork for the understanding of the new economy (Amazon) as juxtaposed to the old economy (Barnes and Noble).
1773,WQD7008,"I thought that they could have gone more in depth in terms of metrics, how to calculate them, and use them in real life situations. The course seemed to focus too much on the type of companies that use data, as well as what type of jobs there are in this field. I didn't find it too relevant or helpful in terms of making me more productive at work."
1774,WQD7008,Prof. Egger is the best. I am so immersed when I am listening to his lecture!
1775,WQD7008,great course

1779,WQD7008,"Enjoyed the course, and loved the excel sheet for the Coffee business"
1780,WQD7008,Needs more comprehensive assignments and challenging quizzes. Other than that the material is excellent!
1781,WQD7008,"The instructor is VERY bad at presenting. SO dry and monotonic. Omg, I really want to learn all this but can't stand him talking."
1782,WQD7008,"A great start to the subject matter. Clear, concise and easily relates to actual business principles."
1783,WQD7008,The course is very superficial in nature and there is no difficulty...
1784,WQD7008,The quality of videos is not good. There is some absurd voice in between. Also the course for week 3 has information related to finance which is beyond understanding levels of a person with no financial background.
1785,WQD7008,It's a great course! I love this course. It helps me to know more about data scientist and data analytist.
1786,WQD7009,Excellent teacher!
1787,WQD7009,A very good introduction to what the specialization will be covering. I am excited for the next course in the specialization!
1788,WQD7009,Super overview of business metrics.
1789,WQD7009,"Introductory course, perhaps a little too light on the details."
1790,WQD7009,Can be packed into a two-week course.
1791,WQD7009,"as a science student, I think the course is easy to learn. It provides a lot of concepts which I can only remember a little though I understand their meanings."
1792,WQD7009,"I learned new concepts to use not only in business, but in my life. I would suggest the availability of the material that is presented."
1793,WQD7009,Instructor and content was brilliant.
1794,WQD7009,Authors are too greedy for the course material.
1795,WQD7009,"Lectures were a bit slow-paced, but the information was great."
1796,WQD7009,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.
1797,WQD7009,"Great content, precise and current. Thank you!"
1798,WQD7009,"This is a nice course to understand what you will do as a Data Analyst or related job positions. Video lectures were cool, however it would have been great if the lectures used can be made available in PDF or PPT form for future use."
1799,WQD7009,very good course introducing fundamental metrics for introductory learners like me
1800,WQD7009,It is very useful
1801,WQD7009,Good for knowing the basis of business analysts!
1802,WQD7009,This course was really fun. I have never thought about some of these aspects of business and really enjoyed having my mind opened in a manner that was easy to understand.
1803,WQD7009,"As a person without a business background, this course gave me a broad, easy-to-understand introduction into the intersection of business and data analytics."
1804,WQD7009,"What's the point of online education if one can only access the assignments if him has purchased the course? With no access to assignments, how could one evaluating his efficient of study?"
1805,WQD7009,This course was useful as a general overview. I plan to take other courses for more specific techniques.
1806,WQD7009,Good Course

1810,WQD7009,Practical and useful course
1811,WQD7009,This is a great course.
1812,WQD7009,"The lectures are good and clear, with many concrete examples and exercices to train. The topic itself is a little limited, mostly to finance, whereas there would be so much more equally interesting diversity in data to analyse. I just don't dream of money all the time.The course limitations for free attendance get in the way of efficient learning though, using cheap tricks to manipulate you into buying, though I haven't seen these features used this way in other curses, I bet they're using what they teach to increase conversion using any way available."
1813,WQD7009,Maybe a little more of application activities but overall very well!
1814,WQD7009,"Loved the content and delivery! Just wish the Quiz and Peer Assignment (I have completed both) were allowed to be submitted without purchasing course. As it will involve no additional effort to faculty. Answers are in the MCQ format so there is only one right answer and peer-grading by its nature ensures that little or no faculty time and effort is used.Like in other Coursera courses, Official Duke University certificate could be paid.Thanks you again!"
1815,WQD7009,"The course content is good. However, by the review assigment i can see that the concepts were not clear, ther"
1816,WQD7009,Great experience and fun to learn.
1817,WQD7009,"I feel like more examples, case studies, or panel interviews would help."
1818,WQD7009,"Clear explanation, easy to understand and relevant for my interest."
1819,WQD7009,"Very much enjoyed the course, its focus on method and real-world problems / issues. The quality of the instruction, including the technical, graphic support was high and always in evidence. The instructor's humor also came through, as well as his upward potential as a dancer. Thanks for the kind introduction to the subject matter; I intend to follow through with the next courses to achieve the Specialization via Coursera. Best from Munich"

1824,WQD7009,The course could be completed in a matter of a few hours. Super basic stuff. Waste of money.
1825,WQD7009,I audited this course as it was recommended by my hubby who is a data scientist and see if i can apply the learnings in healthcare. This has immensely benefited me. Prof. you are so crisp and clear and is easy to understand.ThanksRamya.N
1826,WQD7009,I like the course. It was interesting the way that introduces the basic for doing analysis in a real company.

1834,WQD7009,"The course gave new insights into how name branddata-driven companies as they are called here operate and optimize their revenue.I kind of expected this of companies like Amazon, but the revelation was how even brick and mortar companies need to be data-driven in order to survive."
1835,WQD7009,Very basic terms. Not very helpful for later concepts and would not recommend for business professionals that have experience
1836,WQD7009,Very good intro class to Business analytics. Wish there are more content to learn.
1837,WQD7009,Great course for getting your feet wet.
1838,WQD7009,a very good course.i would like more questions in each video though - and more problems to solve too.but great overall
1839,WQD7009,"Great intro to the different types of data and very valuable information on what companies use what types of data, the real world jobs that they hire in the data world, etc. Loved how practical the information was!"
1840,WQD7009,Good information on data analyst.
1841,WQD7009,"I do not think that students should need to pay for a course in order to watch interviews with previous graduates. Half of this course should have been condensed or excluded. There is not much to learn in these modules. It was decent, but it was not a five star course. I think the ratings on this are misleading."
1842,WQD7009,Good thought provoking class. A good foundation class to take before taking the MySQL or Tableau or Excel stats classes.
1843,WQD7009,Great introduction to the Business metrics!
1844,WQD7009,"A lot of time devoted to the job stuff may not be super relevant for most students, and was certainly not super relvant too."
1845,WQD7009,"obviously this course helped building basic concepts in understanding further business metrics. and the examples used are very close to real life , not at all text book style. I had a great time viewing videos and improve my knowledge with my classmates."
1846,WQD7009,This course links 3 important ideas:1. Measure THAN act2. How do I analyze what's been measured?3. Use computers to facilitate automation and visualization of the 2 above ideas.
1847,WQD7009,Fantastic Course. Lot of things to learn..
1848,WQD7009,Found it boring and pretty irrelevant. I was hoping to lean more on metrics especially in the digital marketing section. Pretty let down and $79 waste
1849,WQE7001,"this is a really interesting course is helping me a lot, looking forward to complete this class"
1850,WQE7001,Very informative
1851,WQE7001,Very good course. A must for everyone.
1852,WQE7001,I really recommend this course. Perfectly explained.
1853,WQE7001,I had a hard time finding material to study.I wish the class had more reading material.
1854,WQE7001,A very useful course for budding professionals. Wouldn't recommend this to middle managers / data experts.
1855,WQE7001,excellent course for begineers
1856,WQE7001,"This is a great course. Very helpful in understanding Business Metrics better and at helping create a foundation in big business and data. Some of the videos around the specific numbers were a little vague on what was an example and what was an actual metric. All things considered, still well worth the time, money and effort! :)"
1857,WQE7001,A good lesson can bring you some great understanding of data-driven company.Worth taking it~!
1858,WQE7001,This is a good introductory course for those who want to be a part of a bussiness analysts team.
1859,WQE7002,Very informative course and gave a broad background about how data is being applied to companies today. I thought it was a good idea to interview people actually using the material and how they apply data to their work.
1860,WQE7002,"""Come as you are and leave feeling like you can conquer data""The learning is quantity combine with quality.The tutors are knowledgeable and detailed.Love it!"
1861,WQE7002,Extremely interesting and really helpful!
1862,WQE7002,Good introduction to the Theme. Some subjects was not entirely connected between weeks.
1863,WQE7002,Eggar was brilliant.but week 4 i could not understand
1864,WQE7002,A very and impressive good insight has been provided.
1865,WQE7002,I highly recommend this course as an example of excellence in teaching. EVERYONE should take this class. It's just that good.
1866,WQE7002,Great course! Clarifies a lot of concepts.
1867,WQE7002,"One of the best courses I've taken through Coursera, but also one of the most enjoyed courses. I'd recommend this course for those interested in learning business metrics and business analysis."
1868,WQE7007,"I am confused with the job titles before. But, now with this course I understood the skills required to get into the job market.Thanks for your efforts."
1869,WQE7007,"Lots of information, and it helps you start doing something in this field right away."
1870,WQE7007,Looking very useful.
1871,WQE7007,The course conveys clear guidance on the fundamentals of business metrics to allow for a strong foundation to hear and process facts into business metric questions.
1872,WQE7007,"If you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series I suggest you look elsewhere. I was able to complete the first course with ease, but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and does not tie in very well with the how excel is used. Don't be fooled by how easy the first weeks assignment is for the second course of this specialization.**My initial rating for this course alone was 4 stars, but due to the lack of effort and information in the 2nd course of this specialization I have to give this 1 star as these courses are all tied together."
1873,WQE7007,"I found this course interesting, but a bit too simple.From the answers of other students that I marked many are non-native speakers of English who hadn't really understood the questions."
1874,WQE7007,"I would have liked the course to have been more hands on. I would have also liked to have seen other platforms utilized.Ex:Hypothetical situations to apply course content to.Group assignments with real time chat.Better formatted supplemental readings to compliment the lecture videos.Also, I feel like the instructors failed to explain some of the business jargon used, which wasn't remedied by referencing the dictionary."
1875,WQE7007,Good course. Clarity in the tutorials and provides a good foundation for understanding essential business metrics for companies.
1876,WQE7007,very informative and great lecture :)
1877,WQE7007,"Wonderful course for a starter. However, there were (although very few) points where a more structured approach could have helped making things easier to understand.But a very helpful course to understand the landscape of the Business Metrics and their application to real-life business problems."
1878,WQE7007,"As a recent college graduate in management information systems, I wasn't taught most of these important business metrics in the context of business, and even then, I was only taught traditional metrics, not the dynamic metrics this course covers. I would highly recommend this course to those who are looking to understand the different measures to check the ""pulse"" of a business."
1879,WQE7007,Great introduction to the Subject
1880,WQE7011,The coursework was very straightforward and prof. Egger made it easy to understand using applicable real-world scenarios.
1881,WQE7012,N/A
1882,WQE7011,Awesome tool to understand the basics of why we're doing this specialization. This is the cornerstone of the right usage of the tools we can see in the upcoming courses. Highly recommended.
1883,WQE7011,Clear to have basic knowledge to know more about data analyst.
1884,WQE7011,"Good introduction to business metrics. I was less enthusiastic about all the investment metrics and formulas, but that might just be me."
1885,WQE7011,Great introduction!
1886,WQE7011,Quality course to learn the base of business metrics. The key terms are explained in a very interesting way. The quizzes are clever and challenging.
1887,WQE7011,"This was a basic, yet interesting introduction into the field of business intelligence."
1888,WQE7011,"Everything was either super basic or else more advanced but so niche that it doesn't really apply to everyone and we don't need to learn it in that depth. Would have liked to learn a lot more about how to determine what KPIs you should be measuring in different businesses, what kinds of metrics are important, etc. The very large majority of this course will never be applicable to me."
1889,WQF7002,Great class and great intro to get excited about data analysis! Very good class for people with any background.
1890,WQF7003,
1891,WQF7002,Very Useful and in touch with real life uncertanities
1892,WQF7002,A practical course to learn about business metrics for any company
1893,WQF7002,"good, but no material and lack of structure"
1894,WQF7002,This was a great course! The content was relevant and was delivered in a clear and concise manner. I will recommend this course to friends.
1895,WQF7002,"I an very disappointed that DUKE hits your up for $79 just to grade the fist quiz (which should cost them $0). This is the fist time I have seen an Institution do this. I can understand charging for a certificate, or for a Final project, but not right out of the gate. I hope that the spirit of Coursera is not changing to a ""pay to play"" site. There are other higher rated Universities that take a more noble approach. I wonder if all the reviewers paid $79 day 1 for this class, or did DUKE recently changed their pricing policy after the reviews..."
1896,WQF7002,I think the pace is a little
1897,WQF7006,Great insights on business metrics with practical approach!
1898,WQF7006,Very interesting course
1899,WQF7006,Very very entry level information.
1900,WQF7006,"Basic, Simplified and great"
1901,WQF7006,"Well done and useful, Thank you."
1902,WQF7006,"Amazing introduction to the specialization, very apt!"
1903,WQF7006,This Course opened up a new mind for me and just from an intelligence perspective i see the world in a different way. I hope to build upon this. Thank You Coursera.
1904,WQF7006,Solid introduction - slightly disjointed and fairly boring presentation.
1905,WQF7006,Very good insights provided from a fresher's point of perspective !
1906,WQF7006,"Thank you Mr Egger, thank you for the engaging first course which introduced me to the world of business data analyst and data scientist."
1907,WQF7006,Loved the overview of the profession and hearing from real data scientists (among others)
1908,WQF7006,good explanation from sound instructors.
1909,WQF7006,"Really useful introduction, helps to orientate oneself on the path to data analysis work"
1910,WQF7006,
1911,WQF7006,This course gave us more basic concept of business metrics and many of them are brand new for me. Professor introduce this course very clearly.
1912,WQF7006,"Well designed, well taught."
1913,WQF7007,This course has been an awesome revision for me about my Management Information Systems concepts.
1914,WQF7007,Contributions of the professor in the discussions is wonderful
1915,WQF7007,"Saya banyak belajar, thank you"
1916,WQF7007,"It is a great introductory course to business metrics and data analysis, very clear and relevant explanations, in a series of attractive and not too long videos."
1917,WQF7007,"For me who thought I knew something about business analysis, this course proved me wrong, and I am very glad I took it. I'm looking forward to complete the specialization."
1918,WQF7007,I have enjoyed the course
1919,WQF7007,Enjoyed this course and the presenter was lively making for good participation.
1920,WQF7007,This course has given me a very good perspective on metrics used by various organizations to help sustain revenue and grow sales.
1921,WQF7009,love the concepts and the possible impact to business analysis to overall business success
1922,WQF7009,Great course!
1923,WQF7009,I thought the course was good - but I think the final case study could have been more specific. I reviewed a lot of colleagues and the quality greatly varied though most got the answers correct since it was a quite general question.
1924,WQF7009,Very Useful
1925,WQF7009,"Good introductory material. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because most of the material was not directly relevant to my business world (pharmaceutical development).Anyone working in a financial environment or in web-based marketing will learn from the business metric examples given.The investment portfolio metrics are useful for anyone who has personal investments, even if you are not involved in finance professionally."
1926,WQF7009,"Excelent!!!, the best course on coursera....!!!!, congratulations."
1927,WQF7009,"Very difficult to apply the knowledge without some support material with the content, e.g. PPT slides."
1928,WQF7009,Very nice lecture videos and explanations! Totally worth it
1929,WQF7009,
1930,WQF7009,"I would not recommend this course for a few reasons:1. There are no course notes accompanying the video lectures. Transcripts of the lectures in unformatted text files and a glossary are available for download. I really can’t figure why the instructor doesn’t provide an outline of what key concepts he wants us to learn from each lecture. Also, I’m surprised that Coursera doesn't require a basic set of learning tools for a paid class, such as lecture notes or an outline. This might be a good class for you if learn well from videos.2. The quizzes contain ambiguously written questions for no good reason.3. Two weeks in and there is little substance. For example, week 2 includes a few Skype videos of the professor interviewing former students from a Duke Master’s program. They seemed like very intelligent and nice people but the content of the videos offered little value (i.e., nothing new) to someone already working in corporate IT."
1931,WQF7009,"Good introductory course, but some kinks need to be worked out particularly in regards to the lectures and assignments."
1932,WVX8001,"This is a great course, and a wonderful introduction to the world of Business Metrics. I did wish it was more data driven (in that I really thought there would be more Excel work), but I'm glad that I took this course because despite the lack of data in numbers it has set me up to do well in the rest of this specialization."
1933,WVX8001,Great class
1934,WVX8001,The idea is whole new to me. Appreciate. Thanks!
1935,WVX8001,This was a good course - I have a finance background but it presented some new perspectives
1936,WVX8001,Dr bagus
1937,WVX8001,"for a successfull career, turn to this course."
1938,WVX8001,A good intro course for those who are starting out.
1939,WVX8001,"Good introduction to business metrics, but not enough practical stuff."
1940,WVX8001,Very good teachers/instructors.
1941,WVX8001,"Concise and interesting course that will help one to understand the basics about business metrics. It is meant for beginners and it is time-saving or better, it's largely up to you, if you want to spend here 1 or 5 hours per week."
1942,WVX8001,This course is awesome. It is a must attend course specially for the people who wants to understand business in better ways.
1943,WVX8001,Good. Looking forward to next.
1944,WVX8001,Baik
1945,WVX8001,Overall good introduction to business concepts.
1946,WVX8001,"Easy to follow, yet comprehensive introduction to the field."
1947,WVX8001,"Good course for those with limited exposure to business metrics. Would be more valuable to include 5 or 6 standard Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) by function (marketing, sales, operations, finance), etc. that will be typically encountered in an advanced undergraduate or MBA program."
1948,WVX8001,Short but an excellent review on typical metrics used to analyse business performance.the sort of introductory course any adult should do at least once and ideally review every few years.
1949,WVX8001,"This is a very quick and effective class to teach you the language and concepts within business metrics. You will also hear descriptions of data-related jobs - what are the roles and differences in skills applied - and these jobs are fairly universal across all industries. The portion of this course that could be better is when the professor throws a bunch of math into the content. It is basically irrelevant to this course, and in and of itself it is so rushed and introduced so out of context that it is very confusing."
1950,WVX8001,A great primer for further data analysis courses.
