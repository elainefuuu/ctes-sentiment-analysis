1604,WQD7004,useful course
1605,WQD7004,great
1606,WQD7004,im take second time strengthen knowledge course one best ive take online past year one course would pay money valuable
1607,WQD7004,good course course good instruction professor
1608,WQD7004,nice course
1609,WQD7004,one word awesome course
1610,WQD7004,excellent begin someone want understand algorithm
1611,WQD7004,thank create course simply step step explain concept algorithms
1612,WQD7004,interest material presentation haphazard incomprehensible typical latin american style presenter wanders erratically material video confuse nonlinear way make coherent note impossible relationship video quiz supplementary reading sometimes hard determine workload also vastly different week week include one reading 200 page indeed whole book whilst lecture demand page worth sadly course one abandon lose patience random frustrating structure limit perplexing nature quiz point bilingual not_means language issue patience use style learn go ahead ive stop sadly
1613,WQD7004,ha sido un curso muy interesante util lo recomiendo para saber como america larina funciona en estos momentos los documentos adjuntos son extremely necesario para disfrutar del curso interest useful recommend know latin america work moment attach file extremely need enjoy course
1614,WQD7004,course retrieve coursera plenty mistake one quiz repeat question not_have relation lecture
1615,WQD7004,video interactive information slide feel slide download not_worth time seem see professor screen important information need take note module need go depth explanation not_especially
1616,WQD7004,great course practical reallife example highly recommend
1617,WQD7004,good introduction although would appreciate reading suggestion look topic depth particularly financial service metric disorient not_to use actual data set final peer assessment
1618,WQD7004,provide good overview metric think good starting point
1619,WQD7004,excellent course structure tuition cant wait get start next one
1620,WQD7004,good content different data role skill require marketplace also good overview different kind metric final assignment make sense helpful apply skill
1621,WQD7004,good stuff informative not_excessively challenge
1622,WQD7004,good concept introduce world business analysis
1623,WQD7004,excellent foundational course introduces important concept study follow course go duke
